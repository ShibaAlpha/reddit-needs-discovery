I understand they\u2019re meant to copy daylight, but I don\u2019t really understand what they actually do. I moved for a one-year project and the weather here is cloudy almost every day. My energy drops hard in the afternoon and I feel sleepy even after drinking a second cup of coffee. Someone suggested light therapy, so now I\u2019m curious. Do sun lamps give you vitamin D like real sunlight? Or is it just bright light that mimics daytime? Because those seem like very different things. I noticed some listings while comparing desk lamps on online marketplaces and they all promise mood and sleep improvements, but none really explain the science behind it. Are they sending special rays into your body, or just helping your eyes reset your internal clock? I\u2019m mostly trying to improve my morning and afternoon focus. If the effect is just waking up the brain faster, that\u2019s enough for me. But if it\u2019s supposed to replace going outside, that sounds too good to be true. Anyone here understand the mechanism in simple terms?",

    "selftext": "Your plans decay in two basic ways: memory and relevance. Memory fades over time including a plan's details, the reasoning behind it, and its connections to other plans or a bigger context. Relevance decays when circumstances change to no longer suit your intended methods, when you learn more about which steps don't work as expected or which alternatives are likely to work better, and when your goals and priorities change so that an old plan may still work, but you don't need or want it anymore.\n\nDecay is natural and unavoidable but you can reduce the speed at which your plans degrade, and you can increase the speed at which your plans are refined, updated, and remembered. Because decay is never zero the only realistic ideal is to make the average rate of improvement (averaged over a day or two) much higher than the average rate of decay, and to maintain this over time. This creates a cumulative effect, a sort of compound interest each day, and provides a sense of both progress and useful novelty as you see your plans going forwards into new territory rather than going backwards or constantly retreading old ground. What follows is one method for pursuing this ideal.\n\nThe basic approach is that of a two page overview: One page of long term context, and one page of short term tasks which often connect to the long term context. Planning short term tasks well is a task in itself, and takes a few minutes to do properly each time, but it also saves far more time than it takes through improved focus, memory, and motivation when implementing those tasks. So it more than pays for itself in time. Making your short term plans in light of your long term context, and using these occasions to gradually update and refine that long term summary, means your understanding of the bigger picture improves naturally and continuously. It also makes short term tasks more meaningful as they're part of a grander design.\n\nThe specific method is this: Plan for a few minutes every few hours, as practical. For short-term tasks include a time estimate that's slightly on the generous side, and a place to record how long the task actually took. Trying to beat your beatable estimate is both motivating and educational. Also for each short term task, leave space to note which longer term projects, schedules, or general arts it contributes to, if any. Not all short term tasks are a part of some bigger purpose but many are and it's worth thinking about. Keep a small part of this to-do page free for miscellaneous notes, including things you don't want to forget but haven't properly broken down into tasks or decided when or how to do them yet.\n\nFor the long term context page divide it into three main categories: 1) Time scales (e.g. to put boxes for \"next few days\", \"next few weeks\", \"next few months\", and \"long term\"); 2) Projects; and 3) Arts (meaning things you want to deliberately learn to do well over multiple examples and projects). Within each category have as many sub-categories, items, subitems as you see fit for a top-level overview. If any one list-level or sublist is more than 10 items long, break it into subcategories or a sublist for easier memory and clearer understanding.\n\nThis two page spread is not a replacement for all other documents and information systems but is an overview to assist your memory and understanding. It's a table of contents, and a means of organising and prioritising all of your plans, including other records you keep, and things you learn from other sources. In fact there are six main kinds of source for learning about and improving plans: Thought, attempts, observation, other people, keeping records, and taking breaks. A written overview acts to set up and orchestrate learning from many sources and to integrate the lessons from each one. It means your various means of learning will all conspire to inform, correct, update, and reinforce each other.\n\nIf you use paper, use strong paper and an erasable pen or pencil so that each double-page draft may persist and evolve for five to ten days in a row, including many edits and updates. Then redraft on a fresh set of pages.\n\nAs long as you leave enough time for practical attempts, observation, learning from other people, and taking breaks, there's not really such a thing as spending too much time on this page. But in general taking a few minutes to update and review it every few hours, then implementing your tasks in between, is a good start. When you're not looking at it, sometimes try to recall and review parts of it, just in your mind. This greatly accelerates your memory and understanding.",

I have always felt mechanically and computationally inclined, but I have not had a chance to pursue further education past high school yet (Im only 20). \n\nI have set a few different, pretty large end goals for myself across each of these areas. Between programming, engineering, CAD, I've seemingly put a lot on my own plate. \n\nThe modern internet is almost completely unable by this point. Idgaf, yeah, \"Google better\". In order to answer many of the questions I have regarding all of these different fields, ive found myself frequently using our modern LLM's to discuss and search across the web for specific info regarding these topics. But I'm still left here feeling unfulfilled. I feel, on the surface level, that I am doing better than I would be completely on my own. I feel like I can garner more usable information across the massively expansive internet. But I also feel like im looking through fogged lenses. \n\nLLM's obviously hallucinate, I have enough common sense to tell when its right in your face. But when I'm researching new topics that I know no prior context towards, I can guarantee I'm sometimes missing complete bullshit spewed to my face. It especially doesn't help that every day I'm met with both articles that people are actively giving away their capacity to THINK in place of AI, and I meet the real deal in person. \n\nI'm scared that I'll never be able to pull myself out of utilizing it for what I feel is justified research, when in reality it is truly my limiting factor. I cannot forsee myself in the future being able to pull away from this and confidently say \"I know what I'm doing\". ",

    "selftext": "I have learnt about it well because of the ample research I have done. Based on the research I did, the leading cause is related to emotional intelligence, the way we relate to ourselves, and how we can be productive and less worried, along with validating ourselves. The specific term is called mild task paralysis, mostly a variation of it.\n\n\n\nThe leading cause, I believe:\n\n1. Overwhelm: When I see a lot of things on Stack, that's the least of the problems. This is in tandem with seeing different things labeled in different colors for different purposes or different states of completeness? I get flustered doing the task I am supposed to do, and even though my colleague thinks I did it well, I just feel like it\u2019s not as good as I know it can be.\n2. Perfectionism: The fear of making mistakes or not meeting high standards can make me feel impossible.\n3. Decision fatigue: Too many choices or unclear next steps can lead to mental exhaustion and inaction. This is tied with issue number 1.\n4. Fear of failure: Worrying about the consequences of getting something wrong can create a mental block.\n5. Lack of motivation: If a task feels unimportant or uninteresting, finding the drive to begin can be a struggle. This is more to procrastination, but I figure.\n\n  \n\n\nI wonder if your guys have faced something similar and what solution you have come up with?",

Only staring at the ceiling and the wall for 30 minutes.** \n\nThat's it. I procrastinated work and paying the bills for a whole month after staring at the ceiling for 30 minutes I got up and worked so hard like I've never before. \n\n**Explanation**: \"Getting bored\" is a fundamental function of your brain to be productive. Your brain makes you get bored so \"going to work\" becomes entertaining. I've researched about this a lot with opinion from neuroscientists and psychiatrists. \n\nFor an easier to understand analogy. It's like the white room experiment. The quietest room on Earth where people could never endure long in that room because it's so quiet your ears become so sensitive you could hear your veins, pulses and heartbeat. This too, makes you gets so bored working becomes productive. \n\nAnd I finally tested it on myself. And yeah I'm going back to work. Hope it helps. \n\nPS; I've been problem solving procrastination for my whole life. I wanted to be a super human. The 5 seconds rule, the \"make tools at arm length\". All those techniques I have them in my arsenal. But eventually you'll reach a stage where you feel \"clogged\" like your engine just won't start or \"you don't feel like working\". Which prevents me from utilizing all those techniques. So this is my new solution to making me feel like working.\n\ntl;dr I actually got so bored lying on the floor that I reached out to pick up a literature, Candid by Voltaire. Only to close it because it was so fun (because I was so bored doing absolutely nothing for 20 minutes into this) it beats the purpose of getting bored. Would probably continue reading it tonight lol. \n\n**TIPS**: During the mean time you are free to ponder philosophically or consult yourself about your future and the importance of the occupation and work you're doing. If it aligns with your ultimate goal YOU will feel like working even more. If it does not, you are free to come up with a new future plan or formulate a reason as to why your current job is important. \n\n",

Four hours of deep work. Simple.\n\nReality:\n\n**night before** living with my girlfriend. Last night we were together until 11:30pm, which means I was almost certainly not asleep until midnight.\n\n**6:40am** \u2014 Wake up automatically. Immediately thirsty, need to pee, feel absolutely destroyed. I stayed up with my girlfriend until 11:30 last night so I'm running on maybe 6.5 hours of sleep. The inertia is physical \u2014 like my body weighs twice as much as usual. My first instinct is to go back to sleep. Instead I use what I think of as \"opposite action\" \u2014 don't think about how bad you feel, just do the next step. I get up. I drink a big glass of water.\n\n**~7:00am** \u2014 Still feel like garbage. I negotiate with myself: okay, not 8am, I'll start at 9am instead. I open my laptop to pull up my calculus textbook. But there's something nagging at me \u2014 I emailed my professor about a missed term test and I don't know if he's replied yet. I sit there for a few minutes genuinely battling whether to check. I don't check. Instead \u2014 and I genuinely cannot fully explain how this happened \u2014 I open a website I'd been reading the night before. It's one of those sites with sarcastic 4chan commentary and I thought it was hilarious. I read it for **thirty minutes** and I'm laughing the whole time. Not scrolling mindlessly \u2014 actually laughing. Which almost makes it worse.\n\n**~7:35am** \u2014 I close the tab, feel disgusted with myself, and decide what I need is a Monster energy drink. I had explicitly, out-loud promised myself I was done with energy drinks. I go to the convenience store downstairs. I buy a Monster. I also buy four protein bars \u2014 I'm doing intermittent fasting, first meal at noon, but I figure one protein bar now is fine. I eat two of them on the walk home (maybe 90 seconds). I put the other two in the freezer, telling myself I'm done.\n\n**8:57am** \u2014 I'm back at my desk. My girlfriend, who's been asleep until now, wakes up and calls for me from her bedroom. I think \"...honestly why not\" and go. I come back at **9:20am**.\n\n**9:20am** \u2014 I immediately eat the other two protein bars from the freezer. No explanation. The fasting is just gone now. I try to start working. It's happening but I'm at like 30% \u2014 slow, foggy, effortful.\n\n**10:30am** \u2014 Girlfriend appears at my door. We spend the rest of the morning together until 11:30am.\n\n**11:30am** \u2014 I sit down. My deep work block produced roughly **40 minutes of mediocre work**.\n\nThe thing that kills me is I *watched* it happen. At every single decision point I knew what I was doing. The 4chan thing \u2014 I knew. The energy drink \u2014 I knew. The protein bars \u2014 I knew. And I did them anyway.\n\nI've read Atomic Habits, Deep Work, GTD. I'm not missing information. My environment is just completely misaligned with my intentions: girlfriend in the next room, phone accessible, convenience store one floor down, no external structure forcing me anywhere.\n\nI'm thinking about shifting the block to **12\u20134pm** since by noon I've naturally recovered, eaten, and cleared the morning chaos. But I'm genuinely not sure if that's a real fix or just procrastination with extra steps.\n\nHas anyone actually solved this? Not theoretically \u2014 actually solved it, in a messy real-life environment?\n\n---\n\n*Not looking for \"just have more discipline\" \u2014 I'm asking what the actual structural intervention was that changed things for you.*",

Settings &gt; Screen Time &gt; See All App &amp; Website Activity\n2. Scroll down and ask yourself for every app: \u201cIs this necessary?\u201d Try to be more restrictive than your mind wants to.\n3. For every app you answer \u201cno\u201d to: Click it &gt; Add Limit &gt; 0m 0s and Block at End of Use.\n4. Make sure to block the website versions too! I fall for it too many times. If you want the block to work across Safari and Chrome: Settings &gt; Screen Time &gt; Content &amp; Privacy Restrictions &gt; Toggle ON &gt; App Store, Media, Web, &amp; Games &gt; Web Content &gt; Limit Adult Websites &gt; Never Allow: Add all your addictive apps here and then some more. All social media, all your news, etc.\n5. Dont skip this: Find a friend/ family member and ask them to set your Screen Time passcode. When you really want to use you tube, knowing the passcode wont help you. They should save it in their notes \u201cKatara screen sime passcode: 2431\u201d (when you trade it in, your iPhone will ask for your Screen Time passcode and not having sucks, trust me)\n\n**Remove Notifications**\u00a0for 99% of apps:\n\n1. Settings &gt; Notifications &gt; Go through all apps\n2. Allow Notifications &gt; toggle off I leave notifications on for: FaceTime, FindMy, Google Maps, Phone, Reminders, Wallet.\n\n**Downtime**: my weakness is nighttime, before bed. So completely disabling my Mac and iPhone before bed was a big part of reducing my screen time:\n\n1. Settings &gt; Screen Time &gt; Downtime &gt; Turn Scheduled ON &gt; Every day &gt; Set the time to whatever works for you, for me its: 22:25\u20136:00. Also, Block at Downtime toggle ON. You don\u2019t need to press \u201cTurn On Downtime Until Schedule\u201d it confused me.\n2. Always Allowed (my list): Phone, Messages, FaceTime, Maps, App Store, Authenticator, Barcode Alarm, Calculator, Camera, Google Calendar, Google Docs, Google Maps, iPhone Mirroring, Notes, Opal, Photos, Reminders, Shortcuts, Voice Memos, Waze.\n\nBonus: making the\u00a0**iPhone look clean**\u00a0(least important by far)\n\n1. Hiding most apps is the big one for me. Leave only 2\u20133 rows of the most used apps. You can search for the ones you sometimes use. Long press Home Screen &gt; Remove from Home Scree.\n2. Gray wallpaper: Settings &gt; Wallpaper &gt; Add New Wallpaper &gt; Color &gt; Gray &gt; I like adding sunset and temperature mini widgets.\n3. Black and white screen: Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Display &amp; Text Size &gt; Color Filters &gt; Toggle on and choose Grayscale. Is this making the phone less addictive? I don\u2019t know, but I got used to it.\n\n**What settings should i add?**",

    "selftext": "I\u2019m a university student, and this feels a bit embarrassing to admit, but somewhere along the way learning started to feel heavier than it used to.\n\nI still like ideas. That part never went away. I like non-fiction because, that it\u2019s practical and sometimes very specific to situations you\u2019re already dealing with. In the past, books like that have genuinely helped me get through tough periods, mentally and socially.  Before university, I used to read this stuff out of curiosity. Now most of my reading energy gets used up by coursework.\n\nBy the time I\u2019m done with classes, assignments, and whatever else the day demands, the last thing I want to do is open another dense book, even if it\u2019s something I chose myself. I\u2019d sit down with good intentions and just stall.\n\nI tried summaries for a while because they felt efficient. And they were, technically. But they also felt very superficial. I\u2019d know what the idea was supposed to be, but not how it got there. They make every concept and idea very succinct and neat, and I\u2019d forget most of it pretty quickly.\n\nLately I\u2019ve been experimenting with listening instead of reading. Not audiobooks exactly, but podcasts: longer conversations around books. What I like is that the ideas actually get questioned instead of just presented as takeaways. The hosts don\u2019t just explain the ideas; one of them often pushes back and questions them from a listener\u2019s point of view, sometimes by dropping the ideas into very ordinary, real-life situations and seeing if they actually hold up. They refer to actual research or studies to aid (and sometime complicate) the authors ideas. I like this kind of back-and-forth instead of one voice explaining things.\n\nI started with a book I\u2019d already read because I didn\u2019t really trust the format. I expected it to feel watered down. It didn\u2019t. If anything, it helped me remember why I cared about those ideas in the first place.\n\nI'm not sure this counts as \u2018real reading\u2019 anymore, but right now it feels more honest. It feels like a way to stay connected to learning without turning it into another academic obligation.",

I left my job in November, after having been in the industry 8 years, because I just couldn't bring myself to do something I hated any longer. Cocaine and alcohol have been issues from time to time that have left me miserable and skint.\n\nI currently take 200mg of Sertraline and have had several therapists over the last few years. The therapy dried up when my health insurance did so it's just the pills for now. I'm not drinking every night, but if I hit a bender, I could easily spend \u00a3700+ in a night or two, as evidenced a week or so ago.\n\nI'm on Universal Credit (welfare) at the moment, and trying to get Job Seekers and PIP (Personal Independence Payment), but really I want to work. I didn't like my old job but that was better than no job and I'd happily pick it back up again, at least to get myself back on my feet.\n\nI owe in the region of 7 grand and sometimes feel so depressed that I can't hack it anymore. On good days, I do get out of the house and go to the gym and try to get better, but nothing so far has gotten me out of this hole.\n\nHonestly, losing my friend is probably going to be the worst thing that will ever happen to me. Carrying his coffin was horrific; it has broken me, but I don't want to use his passing as an excuse. I don't want to continue being a drain, or miserable. I used to be someone people enjoyed being around and now I hate myself most of the time. I want to get better and I'm not giving up.\n\nDo you guys have any tips or stories or anything that might help me in my situation?\n\nI'm a 31 yo male in London, England. Thank you in advance. x",

The more light during the winter the better to get your body to recognize awake time.  As a frugal person I was constantly turning off lights and keeping curtains drawn.  But qs a self employed person it was costing me in the long run by not working as much as I should because my body was trying to naturally go into a sort of hibernation mode.  \n \nWarmth - I keep the house at 70 but I was always cold.  Two pairs of socks, sweaters, etc.  Being cold makes me sleepy. I picked up a heated floor mat for under my desk to rest my feet on and hubby got me heated socks to wear around the house.  These have been a game changer.  \n\nHumidity - Check your humidity levels in the winter, if too low it could be making your house feel colder than it is. Dry air can also affect your sleep quality. \n\nLast tidbit is likely a placebo, but smelling tropical or citrus smells (e.g. essential oil diffuser) also feel energizing for me.  \n",

    "selftext": "If anyone has seen my posts on here, I frequently talk about Microsoft Todo as my task manager. Well.....  There are times I start filling that up and by the time I get that done I am just floored. Not in a good way. I look at the mountain of tasks and don't even know where to start. \n\nA little background.  \nAs a career, I work in IT so everyday forces productivity or the company does not succeed. Not a lot I can change there that Microsoft Todo has not already done.\n\nAt Home.  \nSometimes I have chore projects to complete with my family. Just a list of the chores will go down. Dishes, Front room, Move items from front yard to backyard etc.  This is as big as I will go on organizing. As far as how I do those kinds of tasks efficiently, that is for another post with the concept of time management and delegation / mode switch.\n\nFree Time.  \naw...  now here is where sometimes I just suck. I develop PowerPoint add-ins in my spare time. Sometimes I will work on them. Other times I will look at my mountain of MS Todo tasks and just shrug my shoulders and watch videos online about stupid stuff.  This is where I fail. My lists are so big because the concept of programming when you are one person requires so many sub tasks, that I just decide \"no thanks\".  The key here is to not overwhelm yourself. \n\nThe Realization.  \nSince free time is my issue, and I still want to be productive with it. I need quick wins or something where I can think: \"Yeah I got some stuff done\". So I still make checklists. Today I was making one and it was a paper checklist. This required a lot more effort and I immediately wanted to make the list digital. But that got me thinking.   \n**\"If it takes this long to fill out a paper checklist, how long will it take to complete them?\"**   \nRight then I stopped and said: \"This list is good to go for now\"... That was the lightbulb.  \n\n\nThe Solution.  \nYou need to keep your lists short enough so you don't feel overwhelmed and let them evolve as you complete things.  Here are some dos and don'ts. These will probably mostly be for programming but I think they can be tailored to other workflows.  \n\\* DO make a plan of what I want to accomplish in a step. A small plan like: (I want to finish the feedback on these buttons) Then start making the list  \n\\* DO make a checklist of items that can be done without having to stop and reassess. If you find a task will make you stop and \"think\" it needs to be handled after the others and probably its own group of tasks.  \n\\* DONT keep making checklist items if you start feeling overwhelmed. If you are overwhelmed stop making checklist items and start completing the list.  \n\\* DO let the list evolve. Allow for tasks to be done and tasks to be entered.  \n\\* DONT think that all tasks of the entirety of the project have to be put in. I have personal experience with this and the time to do so, along with the feeling afterwards does not motivate at all. At least for me. This is true for at work, at home and free time.  \n\\* DO try paper lists if you get stuck and are not moving forward. Paper lists make us think differently. They take longer to create and are harder to maintain therefore the tasks are handled differently. You also take the time to think as you are writing it. At least for me.  \n\n\nI know this is a long post but after getting a lightbulb and motivation to continue a project that I have been working on for 2 months, I figured I would share.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or if there is anything I can help with. I appreciate everyone here.",

    "selftext": "**TL;DR:** Tracked my Pomodoros for years. Expected 12 sessions/day, averaged 6 (= 3 hours of real focus). That number became the foundation of every time estimate I've made since. Curious what your number looks like.\n\n\\----\n\nWhen I started my career as a developer, I was the most junior on the team. My one goal was to become someone my team lead could trust. The condition for that trust was simpler than I expected: whenever a task was assigned \u2014 no matter how small \u2014 I'd estimate it, say \"this should take about X,\" and put a due date on the ticket. Surprisingly, a lot of people struggled with this part alone.\n\nEven in an era where AI has boosted productivity, the question **\"how long will this take?\"** isn't going anywhere. So here's what I've learned from years of tracking my own time.\n\n(My examples are dev-centric, but estimation isn't a developer-only problem. If something here maps to your own work, I'd love to hear about it in the comments.)\n\n# Your actual work hours are half of what you think\n\nWhen I first started using the Pomodoro Technique, I expected to hit 12 sessions a day. 25 minutes on, 5 minutes off. 8 hours should be more than enough, right?\n\n**I averaged 6.**\n\nThree hours. That's how much I actually focused out of an 8-hour workday. If that sounds low, try tracking it for a week. Meetings, Slack, a coworker's \"quick question,\" context switching, the thing that was supposed to take 5 minutes but took 40 \u2014 one hour on the clock produces about one Pomodoro's worth of real output.\n\n6 Pomodoros in a day? That's a solid, focused day. 8 to 10? Happens maybe two or three times a month. On those days, you clock out thinking \"damn, I actually crushed it today.\"\n\nThe remaining 2 hours aren't wasted. You're in meetings, chatting with coworkers, grabbing coffee, doing the work that makes work possible \u2014 organizing docs, breaking down tickets, checking blockers. It doesn't feel productive, but without it, nothing actually moves.\n\nSo when I estimate, I calculate 1 day = 6 Pomodoros. If someone's screaming \"ASAP!\" \u2014 I stretch it to 8 and call it a day's work.\n\n# Estimation is sequencing, not predicting\n\nA bigger shift than tracking time was learning to break work down in order.\n\nWhen I estimate something, I list every step needed to get from where things are to where they need to be. In order. What comes first matters more than how long each step takes.\n\nThink of it like moving to a new place. You send the moving truck before you've received the keys. The furniture is unloaded, the door won't open, and it starts raining.\n\nThe same thing happens at work. You deploy the new UI, but the backend isn't serving the data yet \u2014 so users see blank screens. Takes 10 minutes to fix, but in those 10 minutes, support tickets start rolling in.\n\nSo when I break down work, the first question isn't \"how long?\" \u2014 it's \"what comes first?\"\n\nThis is especially true when shipping changes to a live service. It's like changing tires on a moving car \u2014 get the order wrong and it's hard to undo. At some point you're waiting on another team's action, and that wait time is part of the estimate too.\n\nI call this process a \"first pass\" \u2014 before the real work starts, I write out the flow at pseudocode level. Not working code, just something like: \"do this here, then that there, this part might get stuck.\" In 30 minutes, you can start to see whether something is a 3-day job or a 5-day job.\n\n(At one team, this first pass practically *was* the work. Their requirements docs had such a high bar that versions went up to v60 \u2014 at that point, it was basically the same as building it in code. Most tickets on that team ended with \"\\~write spec\" or \"\\~draft document.\")\n\nEven after all that practice, when you're facing unfamiliar territory or tasks with heavy dependencies, estimating the estimation itself gets expensive. Your PM asks \"how long will this take?\" and honestly, **sometimes the answer is \"figuring that out will take a day.\"**\n\n# Scoping is estimation too\n\nThe hardest part of estimation \u2014 and the part people forget \u2014 is the uncertainty you can't control. Stakeholder feedback, decision delays, specs that change mid-flight. But you can't push the deadline to infinity, so you have to draw a line somewhere.\n\nI set an upper limit on feedback rounds. The number varies by project, but without a cap, it never ends. Once you hit the limit, the rest goes to the next version \u2014 unless it's a bug or a critical pivot.\n\nEstimation isn't just \"how long will this take?\" \u2014 it's also **\"this is where we stop.\"** Without that line, your estimate is meaningless. You're trying to predict an infinite loop. So when writing up tickets, I list as many not-to-dos as I can. Writing down \"we're not doing this\" upfront gives you something to point to when someone later says \"can you also do this?\"\n\nAs you break work into subtasks, some uncertain items sneak in. Uncertain and ambiguously important. I mark these as optional \u2014 try it, skip it if it doesn't work. Not quite a not-to-do, but not a must-do either. A gray zone. Flagging these early means you instantly know what to cut when things slip.\n\nThese optionals need to be actively discussed. This works especially well on projects with firm deadlines and clear direction. It's harder in siloed orgs \u2014 you need a baseline of open communication.\n\nAnd this is where trust gets built. \"Optional\" doesn't mean \"sweet, I don't have to do it.\" It means you check feasibility, and if it's easy to bundle in with other work, you throw it in as a bonus. When you do that, the other side starts putting real thought into layering their requirements (required/optional). It compounds.\n\n(Genuine question here \u2014 for those of you in roles where a big chunk of your time is spent waiting on other people's reviews or decisions, like sales or project management: how do you measure your productive hours? Before I was a developer, I did startup operations \u2014 scheduling interviews, ordering office snacks, putting together investor decks \u2014 and honestly, I had zero grip on my own productivity back then. If you have your own system, I'd really like to hear it.)\n\nThat said, I wasn't always good at this. Unfamiliar territory means more uncertainty, which means bigger buffers. I happened to be building a lot of side projects because I wanted to go solo as an indie developer, and that ended up becoming subtask-level experience. (I'd set up payment processing for my own project, then when the same task came up at work, I could estimate it instantly.) New company, new domain \u2014 but at the subtask level, I'd done a lot of it before. My estimates got pretty accurate, mostly because I'd just done a lot of reps.\n\n# But then AI broke the unit\n\nI barely use the Pomodoro Technique anymore. Not because the method stopped working \u2014 the sessions just got too short. Tasks that used to fill a 25-minute block are done in 7 minutes. Some checks take just seconds; even the longer ones rarely go past 25 minutes. The unit doesn't fit anymore.\n\nWhat's changed even more is the shape of the work itself. I queue up multiple tasks for AI, come back to check results, queue up more. The parallelism is on the AI's side \u2014 I can still only look at one thing at a time. Reviewing what the AI did becomes a task in itself. I get more done, but on high-density days, it's physically exhausting. A different kind of tired than deep focus.\n\nI spent years learning to measure my time and give honest estimates. As a full-time developer, on freelance gigs, on side projects \u2014 all of it. But now the unit itself is shaking, and I'm still looking for something to replace the Pomodoro \u2014 not a timer, but a way to gauge what a day actually holds.\n\nAnd a more fundamental shift \u2014 the people asking for estimates, the environments that need them are shrinking.",

Caffeine (tea and coffee)\n2. Songs (i face earworms ) and Movies\n3. Reels and Shorts (i never used insta but i used to watch yt shorts...)\n4. Quora (sometimes vulgar content u know and violent content u know )\n5. P#rn and M#asturbation\n6. Movies\n\n**what helped me in this journey so far :**\n\n1. **leaving tea and coffee completely**\u00a0: First, it helped me in calming my nervous system so I can rest better, sleep better, and nap better. Secondly, I have a little bit of constipation, so it helped me in constipation also.\n2. **leaving songs, reels / shorts**: I experience earworms, where songs I listen to keep repeating in my mind. I stopped listening to music for a while, and it helped me sleep better and think more clearly. The earworms were contributing to my brain fog, and by reducing them, I was able to significantly lessen that brain fog.\n3. **leaving movies**\u00a0: I used to fantasize about it after watching it, and instead of resting it, it makes me fantasize more and increase my brain focus, so I think it is better to reduce it.\n4. **leaving quora**\u00a0: Just a lot of vulgar content\n\n**and my routine is like :**\n\nI wake up at 6:00 or 7:00 in the morning and do all the rest of the stuff, and at night I follow the 11:00-6:00 routine, like I close all the devices till 10:30 and sleep till 11 p.m. last. Actually, I am a college student so I I have no time to make a schedule between this time.\n\n**EDIT : A lot of people are asking where I get stimulation from. ?**\n\n* I get my stimulation from various podcasts and lectures, and I read a lot on different topics like narcissism and astrology and different topics.\n* In addition to that, I didn't put any limitations on my food; I do eat fast food \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0b except caffeine. I didn't put limitations on various kinds of food and love eating different kinds of food, especially sweet things. even before the dopamine detox !!\n* I socialize more than before, and I know if I lowered the dopamine to an extreme, then it will cause motivation issues, work issues, and sleeping issues, because I have done dopamine detox after reading some famous books on dopamine.\n\n**And talking about the benefits i got :**\n\n1. Better energy whole day\n2. clear mind and weird type of sense of satisfaction and happiness in the mind\n3. feeling a bit lonely after 1.5 week mark is done may be still withdrawls are going on\n4. My nervous system is now calm down, so I can have better rest, better sleeps, better naps.\n5. I can think better, in terms of calculation-wise, and now I am present in the moment while talking.\n6. Longer study hours , like i can now study for 6 hrs instead of 3 hrs straight in one sitting \n7. Can socialize more , yeah \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd27\ud83e\udd27 I am an ambivert so , i just need to charge my battery to socialize even a little bit but after this , just mentally energetic that i can socialize more\n\n**Final conclusion :**\n\nnot going to follow these whole my life, except the songs and caffeine part, but will do it every few months, like every three months, 15 days of Dopamine Detox or something like that. That will reboot my system and recharge my body.",

That used to be me \n\nI'd sit down to work, have many tabs open, phone next to me, music playing, switching between tasks every 10-15 minutes thinking I'm killing it. \n\nEnd of the day -&gt; exhausted, brain dead, few real finished tasks and I couldn't figure out why cuz I was literally working all day\n\nSoooo, there's an actual reason for this and it has nothing to do with being lazy or not working hard enough.\n\nYour brain can't focus on two things that need the same type of attention at the same time, like physically can't. When u listening to music without lyrics while working -&gt; totally fine, even helps cuz these two things use different parts of your brain (I do this every day)\n\nBut when u reading something while listening to music WITH lyrics -&gt; your brain is trying to process words from the song AND words from the text at the same time. They're competing for the same resources in your head. Result -&gt; u read same paragraph couple of times and still don't get it lol\n\nAnd this is exactly what's happening when u switch between tasks all day. There's a thing called switching cost in psychology. Every time u jump from one thing to another your brain needs time to reload like closing and opening apps on a slow phone. U don't feel it happening but it's eating your energy every single switch.\n\nWhat actually changed for me -&gt; I started doing one thing at a time (yeah, popular and most helpful advice). Closed all tabs except one, put phone in another room, worked on ONE thing for 1-2 hours. First days felt like I was doing less but I actually finished more than previous times of \"doing a lot\u201d.",

Didn't look for the cable.\n\nSomewhere around minute 35, not thinking about the decision at all - I was actually thinking about why the proportions on a building I was passing looked slightly wrong - the answer arrived. Clean. Obvious. Like it had been ready for a while.\n\nI've read the neuroscience since. Default mode network, diffuse attention, walking and cognition. All of it confirms what that walk demonstrated privately: the brain solves things in the background when you stop foregrounding them, and unstructured movement without audio input is one of the most reliable ways to let it do that.\n\nThe problem is it produces nothing you can log. The walk looks like a walk. The output shows up later in the work, unattributed. So nobody builds it into their system.\n\nI now protect one hour a week with no input and no output.

My university is located quite far away from where I live, and it takes an hour drive to come back home in insane traffic after university. After coming back home, I cannot get off the bed, I just feel very unmotivated with very little energy. My university usually starts at 8 am and ends at 3pm with 30 minutes gap between each course. So usually I cannot study in my break time in the university library. Now how can I get over this? I'm really lagging up with all my courses. Also, due to this reason, I even stopped doing hobby activities and side projects. I feel like a mess for this. Any suggestion will help me a lot. TIA. ",

Not in the sense that they\u2019re \u201cwrong\u201d or harmful, they just don\u2019t generate anything I personally value.\n\nHere\u2019s how I define productivity:\n\n1. Money \u2013 if it puts income in my pocket, it counts.\n2. Joy \u2013 if it brings me happiness or excitement, it counts.\n3. Goals \u2013 if it brings me closer to something I\u2019m working toward, it counts.\n\nMost chores don\u2019t meet any of these three. Dusting, vacuuming, organizing receipts\u2014none of it makes me money, none of it gives me joy, and none of it moves me toward my goals. They\u2019re necessary, sure, but that\u2019s all.\n\nOn \u201cchore days,\u201d I\u2019ll clean the counters, fold clothes, throw out old papers. When it\u2019s done, the house is spotless. And\u2026 it feels hollow. Mentally, I feel like it\u2019s not really me\\*,\\* like I\u2019m living in a space that doesn\u2019t reflect who I am. The comfort comes back when the clutter slowly returns, when the house regains a sense of lived-in chaos.\n\nPS: To be clear: this isn\u2019t anti-cleanliness. It\u2019s pro-priority.\n\nWhen the choice is between scrubbing grout and drafting the chapter that might actually get published, or between organizing a junk drawer and teeing off at the range, I choose the forward motion. We have to stop calling maintenance \"productivity.\" Maintenance keeps you where you are; productivity takes you where you want to go.\n\nThe floor can wait. My life won't.",

You can also only do a task that borders region that you already filled. I found a number of benefits to this:\n\n\n\nPerfectly limits choice. By this one I mean that it gives you choice but not so much that you get frustrated by choosing what to do and helps to avoid avoiding some tasks as you might be in situation where you can't advance unless you complete some of those tasks.\n\n\n\nLeverages perfectionism as you want to color map.\n\n\n\nGives a bit creativity as you can choose what shape to make on the map.\n\n\n\nCan be in your favorite color. You can color map in any color\n\n\n\nGamification! Many people enjoy strategy games and it maybe mainly because of coloring maps as suggested by interesting video \"What people don't get about strategy games\" (won't put link here to not breach rules but I think if you need it you can find it)\n\n\n\nNarrative/imagination.

Easily ordered with the click of a button for your \u201csmoking cessation\u201d. \n\n\\\\- L-Tyrosine: A more distant dopamine precursor. After ingestion, the body independently produces dopamine as needed. It serves as a biochemical reservoir, replenishing stores without flooding the system and forming the foundation for sustained, natural energy.\n\n\\\\- L-Dopa: The secret ingredient. The immediate dopamine precursor. It bypasses the body's limiting control mechanisms and directly and noticeably increases dopamine levels, acting as an acute focus boost while simultaneously stabilizing neurological signals. IMPORTANT: The body does not shut down with L-Dopa. Overdosing on this stuff can cause serious problems.\n\nL-Dopa is sold as a \"Mucuna Pruriens\" extract.\n\nIn the morning, after waking up: Take bupropion. The peak effect will be reached about three hours after taking the bupropion, and that's precisely when you should take L-tyrosine and L-Dopa simultaneously. Then you're ready to drive.\n\nMy personal protocol includes several additional stacks such as nootropics, omega-3 and vitamins, creatine, and more. Feel free to ask if you have any questions.",

I just didn't want to admit how I was spending it like when I actually tracked one full week of what I was doing hour by hour, it was embarrassing (really embarrassing believe me)\n\nWhat you really saying when u say \"I don't have time\" is -&gt; this thing is not important enough for me to do. And that's fine honestly but at least be honest about it\n\nWhat actually changed for me -&gt; I stopped saying I don't have enough time and started saying \"it's not a priority\u201d. \n\nTry it for one week. Instead of \"I don't have time to work out\" say \"working out is not a priority for me\u201d. \n\nSounds different\u2026\n\nCuz once you hear yourself say \"my health is not a priority\" something clicks and you either actually do it or accept you don't care. Both better than lying to yourself every day.\n\nI went from \"I have no time for anything\" to studying,  learning new skills, reading daily, and working out, same 24 hours. \n\nI just stopped bullshitting myself about where they were going",

You can keep your personal windows open and visible to you, but they become completely transparent to any screen-capture software or screen-sharing tools.

It was a lack of execution.\n\nHere\u2019s the uncomfortable breakdown:\n\nLearning = Safe, controlled, gives a quick dopamine hit.\n\nExecution = Risky, messy, and serves you a shot of cortisol (stress) first.\n\nWe often think more information will transform us. But real transformation doesn't come from what you know. It comes from who you become in the act of doing.\n\nThe pivotal shift wasn't: \"I know how to program.\"\nIt was: \"I am a programmer.\"\n\nYou don't open your IDE as a student. You build a feature as a builder.\n\nMy new mantra: Build the muscle of execution, not just the library of knowledge.\n\nI'm curious:\n\nHas anyone else felt this \"knowing-doing\" gap?\n\nFor those who crossed it, what was your breaking point or key tactic?

I feel TOO fatigued at home like I feel it in my bones, and this is literally any minute of the day or night that I'm inside my home. Its almost like my home casts this veil/spell on me and then it incapacitates me from even being able to do the simplest of tasks. Like I feel like I don't even have the strength to pick up two items, or sometimes to even get up and shower or pour a cup of water, and sometimes the tiredness even turns into physical symptoms like a headache. I literally almost feel drugged when im at home. And it stresses me out to see the mess my place has become because of it, because I cant function enough to think as clearly or clean at all. \n\nNow on the other hand, when im at work or any one elses house, I clean like a professionally paid cleaner, do it super fast and well, and also become super efficient at tackling tasks. I literally become super woman compared to the completely different incapacitated me within any inch inside of my home.  \n\nWhy is that ? and I would really love to fix it so that I can be just as high functioning in my own home. My home and I deserve it just as much \n\nEven right now as I type this on my couch I feel so weak and sleepy (both physically and mentally) that its uncomfortable to keep on typing in between.

Do you assign certain days to presentation work? Do you impose strict limits on the number of slides? Do you outsource part of it?\n\nAny simple rules that helped you keep slide work under control would be useful.

I have a whole morning routine. I journal, I review my task list, I plan my day. I felt really good about it honestly. Like I was doing everything right\n\nexcept I kept ending the day having done almost none of the actual important stuff. And I couldn't figure out why because I was \"being productive\" for like 10+ hours\n\nIt finally hit me last week when my girlfriend watched me work for a bit and was like \"you know you've been rearranging that same list for 20 minutes right\"\n\nand I got defensive about it obviously. But then I actually paid attention the next day and she was right. I spend SO much time organizing my tasks, color coding things, moving stuff between apps, tweaking my system. I moved from Todoist to Notion to Obsidian to just Apple Notes back to Notion in the span of maybe 4 months? Each time I'd spend like a full weekend migrating everything and \"setting up my system\" and feeling super accomplished about it\n\nI wasn't doing work. I was doing the performance of work. The planning and organizing felt like productivity because it involves effort and screens and typing but none of it was actually moving anything forward\n\nThe thing that made it click was I tried something stupid simple. I wrote 3 things on a post it note on monday morning. Just 3 things I needed to finish that day. No app, no color coding, no priority matrix. and I finished all 3 by like 2pm. I literally had never done that before. Not once in the past year of my elaborate productivity system\n\nI'm not saying apps are bad or whatever. I just think I personally was using the organization as a way to avoid the actual hard tasks. because organizing feels productive and safe but the real work is uncomfortable and I might fail at it or something idk\n\nhas anyone else dealt with this?

I finished university, got a job, changed my lifestyle to more healthy. I quit all high dopamine games.

I feel more energy, excitement and I didn't feel bad few days in a row. It's really weird.\n\nWhat worries me is that I think about playing almost every day, which sounds like a typical addiction. But at the same time nothing in my life has changed. I still go to the gym, meeeith friends and handle responsibilities as I did before. The only difference is that playing DBD gives me a boost of mood and a kind of unnatural excitement and motivation that contrasts strongly with how I felt before. Like if it was a drug with no negative effects.\n\nI try to understand why that happened. It blows my mind that I don't see any negative consequences.

And then, what if I get 2 million dollars? What if I get 5 million dollars? I feel like by staying abstract I will manifest 10 million dollars, instead of just 1 million dollars, being specific and crystal clear feels a bit or a lot limiting\n\nSo somehow, I wanna understand the meaning behind those words, it's truly interesting, how I never did, I always stayed abstract, always went on with lots of abstraction, like, even Mr. Beast, who's a billionaire says that he doesn't set goals like I wanna be a fucking millionaire, billionaire, have X much subscribers, he says I wanna be the best, and that's it, and I wanna make the best videos and that's what I focus on \n\nSo, somehow still, within me being abstract is power, but still, being clear seems so seductive, cause being clear leads to abstraction, and abstraction leads to clarity, and etc, \n\nHow do you get crystal clear clarity without limiting yourself?\n\nAnd also, in a case of scheduling, what if I achieve something my system expects me to achieve, in the schedule or due date like in 10 years, what if I achieve it now?\n\nNero shaped my whole manifestation and healing journey, but sometimes he says that you shouldn't ask How and it will come to you because How is a surprise, but then he says... you should get a crystal clear clarity on what you want, but what if it's abstract, ah fuck, and how do you even measure stuff like clearly?\n\nI want clarity, I don't need like answers as in like me being right, I wanna go outside of paradigm, so, please help, if you have better logic than mine, and if you felt the same way, cause honestly I feel alone in this one ",

Yesterday I sat down at the couch and talked to my partner after work like we usually do and I instantly fell asleep after they got up to do something. I ended up sleeping for two hours and them making food even tho cooking is usually my responsibility. I feel guilty and bad if I do nothing. I wanna draw more since I wanna do art professionally some day, even if not as my main job, but also gaming is my way of socializing on weekdays but not being able to game because I\u2018m so exhausted is sad.

I have to negotiate with it 24/7 to even convince myself to do the work. This leaves me exhausted when I have to do the actual work that I end up half-assing it. Why does this happen?\n\nWhy can my brain not understand where I want to go? It does 2 things. It either negotiates with me, saying that we can do it in 5 min, etc. Else, it begins pulling up receipts of people who are better than me in that skill, and begins comparing and saying that I can never be like them. And I have to tell myself, \"Yeah, you can never be like them if you don't put in the work. Do the work and you can be like them too\". But my brain is like, \"But they have 3 years of experience, you can never have that\" and this goes on and on until either my brain or I give up, and by then, both of us are exhausted.\n\nThe thing is, this isn't consistent at all. I cannot consistently code for a week, but I have been tracking calories for 400 days now without a break. I can power through the boredom of getting better in a task and practice shooting as a sport, but I cannot read a boring textbook which is needed to understand a subject I am interested in. I absolutely hate this inconsistency with myself and I view it as a sign of weakness.\n\nHow do I make my brain consistent in being disciplined? How can I make my brain not negotiate with me and exhaust me? How do I fulfill promises made to myself? How can I get started to put the effort to where I want to be?",

    "selftext": "Most of the advice I see on r/productivity is about surface-level tips and hacks.  \nBut a lot of the people seeking advice about their productivity problems talk about procrastinating, not being able to start, feeling overwhelmed, feeling unable to focus, mental fog, feeling guilty... feelings! (state)\n\nState dependence means factors like alertness, emotion, stress, and fatigue influence cognitive function, memory recall, and task output. There's plenty of  evidence to support this view:\n\n* **The Yerkes-Dodson law:**\u00a0There is an empirical relationship between arousal and performance. If your arousal is too low (boredom/fatigue) or too high (anxiety/overwhelmed), your Prefrontal Cortex\u2014the part of the brain responsible for executive function loses its ability to regulate focus.\n* **Transient hypofrontality (flow states):**\u00a0Research into high-performance states shows that when we are truly productive, the brain down-regulates the self-monitoring parts of the PFC. This allows for the 500% increase in productivity often reported in flow states, but it requires a specific neurochemical cocktail (dopamine, noradrenaline, anandamide in the right levels and places).\n* **Cortisol and working memory:**\u00a0When we feel overwhelmed, our cortisol levels spike. High cortisol has been shown to physically impair the neural circuits involved in working memory. You feel like you can't think because, physiologically, your brain's RAM is inhibited.\n\nI'm curious to know how many people interested in productivity recognise this as the primary driver behind output, and for those that do, what do you do about it!?\n\n",

Or do you connect it to your bank account?. and it automatically logs it?, do you trust these apps to connect it to your bank account? I'm trying to understand how people actually use this type of app, and how we can improve the input and make it more engaging and much easier to do. I actually bought an app that allows for easier logging of expenses, but I stopped using it, maybe because I'm lazy. And I don't want to log in every single expense I do. I'm sure you have either your apple Pay or maybe Google Pay. Maybe you have some cash in hand. Maybe you do some transactions, or maybe someone sends you some money. Do you actually log all of that? My question is about the input here. if you have a suggestion on how a personal finance app can have much more engaging input instead of inputting one by one expenses throughout the month?. Do you actually care about managing multiple accounts and cash, or only managing expenses? Which charts are the number one chart that you care about?",

It's the thing when you work on something specific during some time, check the progress, result, REFLECTING and then deciding if u should pursue further.\n\nIt's really important to remember into what you spending your energy. Let's imagine you are at corporate job, working as hard as possible, and getting slight pay raise. But if u just work at the same level as others, and at the same time focus on side hustle or investing, it would def lead to better results and new skills cuz most people not doing anything beyond their job -&gt; you have higher probability to succeed.\n\nOr just take example from 50-100 years ago, people worked hard af during industrial time, but only some just achieved something. Success is not about only working time, as I said it's about reflection. But what is reflection actually?\n\nWhen you look at your progress and deciding to change something, yeah this \"change\" is highly critical. This change is the same as taking the risk. So, if you not doing this, you will probably get the same result as previously, cuz without change -&gt; same inputs -&gt; same outputs.\n\nAs a teen, Ive been doing a lot of crypto hustle, although I got some good results, I could spend this time more effectively which could lead me to another better point of my life. Based on this reflection, I'm changing this, better late than never.\n\nThat reflection process changed everything for me. I started writing down what I actually did each day, not what I planned. Then at the end of each week I'd look at it and ask myself: was I working on the right thing or just staying busy?\n\nOfc, changes are hard af but what u prefer: quick discomfort or being in the same position u been several years ago?",

That lasted maybe three months.\n\nI don't know when it started but at some point I stopped using my desk entirely. It became a place to dump laundry. Every morning I would just grab my laptop and sink into the couch. Then the couch became my office, my lunch spot, my Netflix spot, my everything spot. I was replying to slack messages at 11pm in the same position I woke up in. Last month my manager asked me to turn on my camera for a call and I realized I was literally horizontal. I had to pretend my camera was broken because I could not sit up fast enough without it being weird.\n\nI started seeing a therapist a few weeks ago, mostly for anxiety stuff. At some point I mentioned how I felt like I was drifting through days and she asked me where I work. I said the couch. She kind of laughed and said something like, your brain can not tell the difference between work and rest if you never move. It sounded too simple to actually matter but it stuck with me.\n\nSo last week I cleared a corner in my bedroom. Got an old desk off marketplace for 40 bucks. Bought an actual desk chair because the dining chair was killing my back. First morning sitting there felt stupid honestly. Like I was playing pretend office. But I also finished more actual work by noon than I had in weeks. I am not saying it fixed everything. Some days I still end up back on the couch by 3pm. But at least now I notice when it happens.\n\nTwo years of drifting and the answer was literally just sitting somewhere else. Wild how that works.\n\nEdit: okay so a few people asked what my setup looks like now. Honestly I skipped the cheap desk route because my back was already complaining from two years of couch posture. Figured if I was finally going to commit to a real workspace I should just do it right. Ended up getting an electric standing desk from Colamy. Being able to switch between sitting and standing actually helps more than I expected, especially around 2pm when I start feeling sluggish. I used to think standing desks were kind of gimmicky but just hitting a button and changing position keeps me from losing focus. Still not a perfect system but way better than the couch era.",

I think the thoroughness of what I've got is great for recording a lot of information, say, if I want to save raw notes to incorporate into a project, or a long list of books to read - but as a to-do list, I think it plays to my tendency to distraction chasing too many things at once. \n\nWhat I'd like: I'm hoping to set up some kind of living flowchart, where tasks exist as colored boxes or cards, like a Kanban board, but they are connected horizontally by lines with successor steps going on into the future to the right - and then as I check them off, they migrate left. Ideally I would also be able to have some kind of system for recurring tasks where they cycle through on a schedule, and it would also be important to be able to expand them to include details or notes, or link to other files. \n\nDoes anyone know of some kind of application that can accommodate this for someone who really isn't that technical - I don't code, I don't have a GitHub, so a lot of really powerful applications feel overwhelming, and I really don't need a lot of complexity or automation.

    "selftext": "\nHi! :)\nI'm a 23 year old male from India and I think I have truly pushed procrastination to it's limits. However important the work at hand is and how much ever time I have I always end up doing it at the last possible minute. \n\nIt's not even like I'm not aware, I constantly think about the consequences of what I'm doing is, I'm very aware I'm procrastinating yet I just don't seem to bring myself to actually do work. \n\nI'm pretty good at my job and I think I have a little spark of talent in my field but I'm worried I'll never achieve my potential because of how pathetic I've become. Ever since I was a kid it's the same thing, 'lot of potential, just needs to put his head to it\n\nI'm working a literal dream job now and even over here i catch myself making my life harder. Even when I know I'm working a dream job i can't stop myself from procrastinating even when I'm doing it while being fully self aware. I have the chance to work with people I've idolised and even that can't seem to get my ass to work. I don't think anything can motivate me. I love romanticising an end product or planning it out but when it comes to actual effort it's 0. \n\nWorst part is sometimes I don't even finish the work on the deadline day, the last day I finally wake up and then instead of working I drown in self pity about this horrible habit of mine and then just go to relax or chill out cause i deserve it. I then come up with excuses to buy some extra time and then do it quickly. It's very pathetic. The fact that this is a pattern and I'm always self aware in all these steps scares me. \n\nPlease, if any of you have dealt with this before or have any advice it would be godsent. I feel like I'm too old to be like this and am constantly disappointing myself and the ones that love me. I just don't want to spend the rest of my life like this. ",

    "selftext": "For almost 2 years I tried tracking habits on my own. Notion, Todoist, spreadsheets, even a physical journal at one point. Always the same cycle. First week feels great. Checkmarks everywhere. Second week still decent. Then I miss a day, then another, then I quietly stop opening the app and pretend the whole experiment never happened.\n\nI went through probably 5 or 6 different systems. And every single time I told myself the problem was the app. This one is too complicated. This one doesnt have streaks. This one doesnt look good. So I'd switch and start the cycle again.\n\nThen something embarrassingly simple changed everything: I started tracking where other people could see what I was doing.\n\nNot an accountability partner. Not a group chat. Just a space where I could see other peoples habits and goals and they could see mine.\n\nThats it. Thats what fixed it.\n\nHere's why I think it works. When you track alone theres zero consequence for skipping a day. Nobody knows. Nobody cares. Its just you and a checkbox. And on the days you dont feel like it, which is most days if were being honest, theres nothing pushing you to open the app.\n\nBut when you can see that some random person checked off \"deep work 60min\" every single day for the last 3 weeks.. something shifts. Its not shame exactly. Its more like.. if this person can do it why cant I. You dont even know them but somehow their consistency becomes your motivation.\n\nI think this is the same reason people work out more consistently at a gym than at home even when they have the exact same equipment. The presence of other people doing the work creates an invisible standard you want to match. Nobody is watching you specifically but the environment itself is doing the heavy lifting.\n\nBeen going for over 2 months now. Which doesnt sound like much but for someone who never made it past 2 weeks with anything.. its everything.\n\nThe thing nobody told me about habits is that the system doesnt matter nearly as much as the environment you do it in. You can have the perfect app with the perfect routine but if youre doing it in complete isolation with zero social energy around it.. good luck lasting more than a couple weeks.\n\nIf youre stuck in the same cycle of starting and stopping, maybe the problem isnt your system. Maybe its that you're doing it alone.\n\nJust putting this out there in case someone needs to hear it like I did.",

After waking up I did a 20 second cold shower! I did a normal shower and then at the end instead of contemplating life for 20 minutes, I counted from 10 to 0 (I still had soap on me and waiting for it to get off lmao) and turned to max cold, did 20 seconds (or 20 breaths idk), the problem is that i felt my head freezing for a few minutes and now I have a little headache lmao, I think I should do it on the shoulders instead.\n\n1- it was a lit easier than the other day (still a bit hard but not as much)\n2- it made me feel so proud!

    "selftext": "Plans decay in two ways: memory and relevance. Memory fades over time including a plan's details, the reasoning behind it, and its connections to other plans or a bigger context. Relevance decays when circumstances change to no longer suit your intended methods, or when you learn which steps don't work as expected or which alternatives are likely to work better, and when your goals and priorities change so that an old plan may still work, but you don't need or want it anymore.\n\nDecay is natural and unavoidable but you can reduce the speed at which your plans degrade, and you can increase the rate at which your plans are refined, updated, and remembered. Because decay is never zero the only realistic ideal is to make the average rate of improvement (averaged over a day or two) much higher than the average rate of decay, and to maintain this over time. This creates a cumulative effect, a sort of compound interest each day, and provides a sense of both progress and useful novelty as you see your plans going forwards into new territory rather than going backwards or constantly retreading old ground. What follows is one method for pursuing this ideal.\n\nThe basic approach is that of a two page overview and memory aid: One page of long term context, and one page of short term tasks which often connect to that long term context.\n\nPlanning short term tasks well is a task in itself, and takes a few minutes to do properly each time, but it also saves far more time than it takes through improved focus, memory, and motivation when implementing those tasks. So it more than pays for itself. Making your short term plans in light of your long term context, and using these occasions to gradually update and refine your long term summary, means the clarity of this bigger picture improves naturally and continuously. It also makes short term tasks more meaningful as they're part of a grander design.\n\nThe specific method is this: For the short term page, for each task include time estimates that are slightly on the generous side, and a place to record how long the task actually took. Trying to beat your beatable estimate is both educational and motivating. Also for each short term task, leave space to note which bigger projects, schedules, or general arts it contributes to, if any. Not all short term tasks are a part of some larger purpose but many are and it's worth thinking about. Keep a small part of this to-do page free for miscellaneous notes, including things you don't want to forget but haven't properly broken down into tasks or haven't yet decided when or how to do them.\n\nFor the long term context page divide it into three categories: 1) Time Scales (e.g. to put boxes for \"next few days\", \"next few weeks\", \"next few months\", and \"long term\"); 2) Projects; and 3) Arts (meaning things you want to deliberately learn to do well over multiple examples and projects). Within each category have as many sub-categories, items, subitems as you see fit for a top-level overview. If any one list-level or sublist is more than 10 items long, break it into subcategories or a sublist for easier memory and clearer understanding.\n\nThis two page spread is not a replacement for all other documents and information systems but is an overview to assist your memory and clarity of thought. It's a table of contents, and a means of organising and prioritising all of your plans, including other records you keep, and things you learn from other sources. You could say there are six main kinds of source for learning about and improving plans: Thought, attempts, observation, other people, keeping records, and taking breaks. A written overview acts to set up and orchestrate learning from many sources and to integrate the lessons from each one. It means your various means of learning will all conspire to inform, correct, update, and reinforce each other.\n\nIf you use paper, use strong paper and an erasable pen or pencil so that each double-page draft may persist and evolve for five to ten days in a row, allowing many edits and updates. Then redraft on a fresh set of pages.\n\nAs long as you leave enough time for things like practical attempts, observation, learning from other people, and taking breaks, there's not really such a thing as spending too much time on this page. The more you use it the better you'll remember and understand it. But in general taking a few minutes to update and review it a few times a day, then implementing your tasks in between, is a good starting point. It might take about 5% of your time, and improve the rest of your day by much more than 5%. When you're not looking at it, sometimes try to recall and review parts of it, just in your mind. This greatly accelerates your memory and understanding.\n\nDoes anyone else use a method like this, or what other strategies do you have to speed up the improvement of your plans or slow their decay?",

    "selftext": "So I (18F) am doing pretty mediocre in life right now. I\u2019m in college but I cannot focus on homework or my own personal goals because I get distracted and space out a lot.\n\nI notice sometimes in class I can be looking at the board and not paying attention because I am day dreaming. and at night I always spend 1-2 hours on my phone listening to music and getting absorbed in fantasies.\n\nI also feel like its making me kind of a shell of myself as I don\u2019t really get out a lot. When i think about it most of my goals are achieved only in my fantasies meanwhile I dont do anything in real life. I have a lot of goals like exercising kore, joining clubs and learning how to draw but I cant do anything because I always procrastinate and sometimes dont even realize that I am.\n\nI have a couple distraction blockers on my phone but they do not help witht he daydreaming part as I can daydream even just laying in bed or when I feel bored. Its like scrolling tiktok but in my head lmao. I want to know how to get out of my own head and focus more.\n\nAny advice from those who suffered from this? Sorry for the long post and thanks for reading. Please dont comment anything overly nihilistic or pessimistic on my post as I am looking for advice n midterms are coming up and I want to study and focus \ud83e\udd72",

    "selftext": " I used to announce my goals to everyone. Going to the gym five days a week. Waking up at 5am. Reading 30 books this year. Writing every day. People would say \"that's awesome\" and I'd feel good and then quietly never do it.\n\nTook me embarrassingly long to figure out what was happening. The announcement was giving me the emotional reward of the achievement without the actual work. My brain got the validation hit from saying it out loud and then lost the hunger to actually do it.\n\nSo I flipped it. I stopped sharing goals entirely. Instead I started telling one friend my schedule for the week. Not \"I'm going to work out more\" but \"I'm going to the gym Tuesday and Thursday at 6pm.\" Not \"I'm going to read more\" but \"I'm reading from 9 to 9:30 before bed tonight.\"\n\nThe difference is wild. A schedule is specific enough that someone can check on you. \"Did you go Thursday at 6?\" is a real question. \"Are you working out more?\" is a question you can dodge forever.\n\nI also noticed that scheduling things made them feel like appointments instead of aspirations. I don't debate whether to go to a doctor's appointment. It's on the calendar so I go. Somehow putting \"gym Tuesday 6pm\" in the same system as my meetings made my brain treat it with the same weight.\n\nIt's a small shift but if you're someone who's great at setting goals and terrible at hitting them, try making it about the schedule instead. The goal is the direction. The schedule is the vehicle.",

Currently am trying to piece my life back together, but it is very difficult, I am juggling so many things. Getting back my motivation to study for school, fixing my mental health and being consistent with physcial therapy, repairing my relationship which turned rocky due to me being very emotional during those 3 months, chasing my business idea,ect. Another thing that has been eating me up is money. I had watched my savings go from 5 digits to 4 digits, and I always had a goal of having a certain amount \n\nOf money by the time I graduate school, and that goal has practically been cut in half. I know it isn\u2019t healthy and money isn\u2019t the whole world. I\u2019ve been taking baby steps, like consistently journaling, eating healthy, portioning and timing my meals, waking up an hour early before school, small study blocks, small things like that but yet I still catch myself slipping. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m depressed, but I\u2019m angry and lost. Bought a vape a few weeks ago, which I was told strictly not to do by my doctors. smoked for 5 minutes and threw it out in regret. I doomscroll an unhealthy amount. Just feels like my body wants to resort to being a dopamine machine and get back into bad habits. Before my injury I was on top of the world.

    "selftext": "TLDR;\n\nI constantly avoid and procrastinate any kind of task, ranging from self hygiene - stemming from feeling disgusted by myself when I look in the mirror and genuinely feeling like I don't want to be me, to any work/school/hobby related task - knowing if I start I will have to stay committed for years to become good at it. Also avoiding making new connections, because of fear of them finding out that I'm actually a looser. I know the practical steps to take, but battling my mind every time it comes to keeping up consistent action. Doesn't feel like I can control these emotions, rather that they control me.\n\n\n\nInitially I didn't expect this post to be this large, so I'll break it into categories.\n\n\n\nMY LIFE RIGHT NOW:\n\nI'm 21 yo male and I hate my day to day life. I literally abandoned any form of responsibility and now I have literally nothing going on in my life. All I do is sit at my laptop going from games, to shows, to Youtube, to p\\*\\*\\*hub. Occasionally I get tired and switch to my phone for short form content. \n\nThat's literally it - I don't brush my teeth, I don't cook ( I either order a delivery or throw food in the oven and take it out when its ready), I don't go to gym, I don't have hobbies, I don't see friends, I rarely see family, I have no job, I don't study. Literally 0 commitments, I live in Finland so I get money from government by sitting on my ass (that's just how benefits works in here, lol). \n\nGrowing up I knew I won't settle for 9-5 job, I just instantly knew how miserable it would be to work for someone, for medium wage, for 60 years of your life, I knew I had to find another way out. Although I have all the time in the day to do anything - I still avoid everything.\n\n\n\nMY BACKGROUND\n\nWhen I was 1.5-2 years old my father abandoned me and my mother. \n\nI realize how stressful of a time it was for her, I remember how we ate the bland pasta and I had like 1 sausage and she had none. \n\nI spent a lot of time at my grandmas place, one day me and her came back home from the store and I walked into the kitchen finding my gramps face down into his plate, apparently his heart stopped after taking few shots of vodka, that he had right next to him to drink down the food, pretty standard practice in Slavic countries(I'm originally from east Estonia, in a city that borders Russia). \n\nI can't recall how I felt, I guess I was just shocked, my grandma took me to the other room and closed the door while she called the ambulance, don't remember much more.\n\n In few years my mother met a guy that I later started calling a father, he came in clutch, we all moved to Finland, I had to learn the language from scratch, I switched few classes and in 6th grade we moved the city, I remember it was a big deal for me, because I lost all my friends I grew up with. I think I quickly learned that nothing lasts in this life. \n\nFor up until this point I actually forgot that my real father abandoned me. In high school I actually was very expressive, I did what I wanted, said what I though. \n\n\n\nFIRST ACTUAL HOBBY\n\nIt was the time I got really into producing beats, I was really into music overall, I always had an Airpod in my ear, like literally 50% of the day I was listening to music, till this day I find some songs to just ease my life in the way nothing else does, I just forget everything and just feel it. \n\nAnyway at this time 2017-2020 rap was really popular and I was really into that so much so, that I grew my hair for a year with a single goal of getting dreads (I'm white xD). Honestly everyone who knew I want them told me not to, but I had this don't give a f\\*\\*\\* attitude so I didn't care what anyone said. I also remember constantly thinking I will succeed, no matter what happens, who says what, like on some Naruto sh\\*t. (I really miss this feeling, it felt like I can do what set my mind to, somewhere on the way I lost it.)\n\nSo I finished high school and it was time to go to university or find a job, I knew I wanted to make music and I knew that there are no school that teach beat-making, that's all I wanted to do. But by the words of my parents I don't have talent, and their only argument was: \"Do you know how to play this guitar that you had for 5 years\", I said \"No\", \"Well then you are not a musician.\" We had few more discussions about how I really don't want to be stuck in this work life everyone else is, but my arguments had no weight, since they are older and they know better. \n\nEventually I stopped making beats and for very long time everyone who knew that I made music asked me if I cooked something up, or when is the next drop and I couldn't really explain at that time why I even stopped making music, I was just saying that I don't feel like it for some reason. \n\n  \nRELATIONSHIPS WITH WOMEN\n\nEvery time I see a pretty girl I freeze up, I avoid eye contact, I avoid talking to her, I literally get paralyzed, EVERY, SINGLE, TIME. Sometimes I end up committing, but my palms sweat, my voice is shaky, etc. I don't actually know what I'm scared of, I just am. This is pretty general with actually most strangers, it is hard for me to keep up the conversation with anyone I don't know on personal level, but committing to talking to pretty girl is 10x scarier.\n\nAnd the worst part is actually when I read the signals that the they are sending me or even when they or their friend straight up tells me that they have a crush on me I still rather decline to not fuck up later on.\n\nI never had a girlfriend and this hits deep for me, since everyone I know either has/had a bf of gf.  I know I shouldn't compare myself, but this is reoccurring problem for me in every aspect. When I actually see talented people on Instagram I envy them, because I'm not like them, even though I understand how much they have practiced prior to that one perfect clip.\n\nBack to the biography, after that I dropped out of my first major on the first year, I was told that either I apply to another major or I will be denied any access to internet and everything else. So I applied to another major, I met a girl that played me like crazy.\n\nShe had another dude and I knew it , since she always complained to me about him and I was like this good guy that she friend-zoned. \n\nSo half year past I literally stopped talking to her and going to school and didn't tell my parents anything about it, I think I spent like 1 month in my own room without going outside or contacting anyone, this was also the time when I started avoiding my family members.\n\nRELATIONSHIP WITH PARENTS\n\nWe lived in the same household, but we also didn't have anything to say to each other, there was 0 dialogue, only generic small talk if even that.  I learned to be sneaky, going to kitchen at night, waiting for them to leave to work to go to bathroom, moving through house when my mom went to smoke, I literally tried to be invincible and it only got worse with time.\n\nI also didn't spend time with my brother nor my sister and I deeply regret it now. nowadays I really keep contact with both of them, but energy with my parents is almost the same, they also act like nothing happened and that one time when I did bring it up the fact that our relationship is not normal, there is no connection between us, I couldn't talk to them for almost a year after, because they kept saying that everything is fine and that it's cannon event in every family.\n\nNow I still see them from time to time, they try to be warm and not ask a lot of questions about my life. From one side thank god they ain't asking because I ain't telling them that I literally step over thrash and just play games all day. From the other side, do they even care about me bruh. It's hard for me to open up, I tend to just say everything is fine, there are not a lot of people I can trust, even though I'm putting this online, there is some sense of anonymity I guess. Talking in person is way harder.\n\n  \nLIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL?\n\nWhen I dropped out second time I was diagnosed with severe depression and put on meds, I don't know if it was the meds or my mentality shifted again, but I started going to gym, really consistently, for like a year and a half at that time. More than that I had a full morning routine, I was meditating, taking cold showers, stretching, listening to podcasts, journaling etc. For anyone curious it was SSRI, **Escitalopram (Lexapro).**\n\nI also got a job at the store, I was putting products on the shelf, but somehow I wasn't even mad about that, since I finally had own money, and could spend it on whatever I want. Prior to getting the job in the store though, I was stealing from the same store, and actually got caught, so eventually they caught onto that I'm the same guy that is now working there, so they transferred me to another store.\n\nAbout 4-5 months in, I stopped taking meds and still felt fine for like a half a year, but after getting transferred it went downhill again, I stopped doing my morning routine, I was sluggish at work, eventually dropped gym, and then stopped working and got into the same depression rut again, I started smoking a lot of weed, and there were some ups and downs, but everything was pretty much the same for the past 3 years,\n\nI moved out from my parents, I had some motivational bursts of energy to start lifting again or produce music for like a week, but nothing sticks anymore, I understand all the possible trauma and fear, I understand that I have to process it and let it go, it's just... I can't stop avoiding it, I can't move on... \n\nI keep blaming myself everyday for how my life could've been. I recognize that since I have nothing to achieve in real life, I'm binge buying games on steam and my only goal is to complete as many games on 100%, since that is the only way for me to feel sense of progression without actually committing myself to a real life, it is also a way to escape from my miserable life.\n\n\n\nI'M LOST, BUT AT THE SAME TIME I'M NOT?\n\nI cannot say that I'm lost, I actually day dream a lot of how I want my future life to look like, I can picture a lot of aspects with so much detail, but won't list them all here for the sake of saving time.\n\nI know what I want to do in my 20's, I know when I would like to settle for family, I have ideas of what I would like to work on in my elderly years, I know how I want to look and act. I also know what things I need to practice and what qualities I have to attain in order to achieve this dream life, but for some reason every time I stop daydreaming and start thinking of the next step I just avoid. I recognize that my vision is grand and most likely impossible to achieve everything I planned for myself, still I can't even start perfecting one of these aspects and that makes me really mad at myself.\n\nI'm extremely good at learning basics, and being average in a very short amount of time      ( I'm not saying this to brag I just noticed people who I tend to start with often are asking me for advice early on, later on we kind of even out).\n\nfor me the learning curve always went like this - Get curious about something, dump a lot of hours first few weeks - months - learn all the basics and become average, hit plateau, drop the activity. Sounds like ADHD, but idk, haven't been diagnosed.\n\n\n\n\n\nCLOSING THOUGHTS\n\nI'm making this post to maybe pick on my fears and obstacles in my life , honestly I don't expect anyone to actually give me the answers I'm looking for. It is not that I don't know what to do or how to do. Everyone saying to start small or focus on one aspect at a time, or be kind to yourself, but what I need is a reason why. \n\nWhy should I stop avoiding my life when it feels so safe? \n\nYeah, there is no growth, yeah, I feel miserable, but it seems like my brain is wired for just surviving, I feel like I'm in constant stress, always expecting something from myself and if I fail, then it hurts, a lot. Feels like I'm always in fight/flight/freeze, so I never get to just LIVE. \n\nI wish I could just pack my bags and go traveling, or go talk to that stranger, or post this song/clip even if its bad, but I start overthinking, even this post, until I feel like it actually is good and makes sense I won't post it, I will re-read this 100 times before pressing that button. \n\nWhy do emotions have so much control over me? Why can't I just do what I want, despite the fear? Why do I just freeze up or end up avoiding social situations? Why don't I do things that I once enjoyed and probably will again if I just loosen up and give myself margin for error?\n\n\n\nPs. This is actually my first ever Reddit post, lol.\n\n",

I work from 5am-9am, go home, eat and either sleep for 5-6 hours or doomscroll on the phone all day. I been trying to get rid of the dopamine but its hard.

Obviously I have lied and said im doing \"excellent\" which is not obviously and also has ask my mom so many times. I feel like I can't breath and worst if I tell him that im not studying and on suspension. Other part is the relationship with my immigrant mom. She sacrificed for everything and I have not show her with having a life career. Our relationship between Mom and Son has been the worst. Almost 99% she doesn't talk to me and she's very mad and 5% she's happy and loves me. I truly have felt su*cidal and end all. But ik that it will turn things worst. Having a little sister that looks to me a lot. Ever since coming to the u.s, has been very bad. My life completely changed when escaping my country in South America. I really wanna change. I started to invest in brokerage, hysa and had opened a roth ira in June 2025, its just having a higher income and career wise. I have started to take stress pills because I really never been chilled or actually be happy. I had friends but said many bad things that I completely destroyed. My friend became day trader after a worker in the company worked and show me what he was doing day trader and making a lot of income, I put my friend into his mentorship and he started to make money after just 6 months. I was happy for him. But then I realized, I really never focused on myself or just have not been full focused. For reason I block him. It wasn't anything bad towards him. I just simply lost control of emotions. At this point, I don't know what keeps me going everyday, I really want to end it all but idk why im still alive.",

Yet, as humans we continue to want to default to our lesser selves.\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about this a lot.\n\nEven when you have motivation and start some new habits. Day1 is easy, Day 7 you feel good and it\u2019s all fine, but around day 14 it\u2019s like your body wants to go back so bad, and you have to fight with yourself.\n\nFor me I find it so interesting that I even have to have this battle with myself. And when it gets challenging this gives me a weird motivation to keep going. \n\nI have found for me, having people along on the ride with me, trying to reach the same goals makes things so much easier. And it makes me wonder if as humans we aren\u2019t supposed to try to do this stuff alone? \n\nWhy do you think this is? What has helped you stay disciplined?",

    "selftext": "I never had a problem knowing what I should be doing. The problem was always the same: I'd do it for a week, maybe two, and then it would quietly disappear from my day. Not because I stopped caring, but because it never had a place.\n\nThe fix, when I found it, felt almost too simple.\n\nYou take something you already do every day, something so automatic you don't even think about it, and you attach the new thing directly to it. That's it. The fancy name is habit stacking. \n\nThe reason it works is that the hardest part of any habit isn't doing it. It's remembering to do it, and then deciding to do it in the moment. When you attach it to something that already happens automatically, both of those problems go away. The old habit does the work of reminding you, and there's no decision to make because you've already decided.\n\nLet's say you want to write a blog, a journal, or anything, but you never actually do it. Try stacking writing onto an existing habit. Half an hour after you brush your teeth? After your morning coffee? After your afternoon tea? What you stack it onto doesn't matter. What matters is that the original habit is already ingrained, something you do without thinking.\n\nWant to go to the gym but always miss it? I used to as well. Then I made a plan with a friend to go straight after work, before my body had relaxed and I'd already cracked open a beer. Once you're on the couch, it's over.\n\nYour parents always complain that I don't call regularly. I know, life is busy and we forget. I go for a walk a couple of times a week and decided to call them while I'm strolling. Now they think I call too often!\n\nDon't get time to check Reddit? Stack it onto your lunch or dinner, whatever suits you. Spend half an hour after enjoying your food, and see your karma go through the roof. Reddit's algorithm will love your consistency.\n\nNeed to do something every week, but can't remember? My GP told me to take vitamin D every week, but I'd forget for weeks at a time until I stacked it onto bin day. Every Thursday, we have to put out the bins. After putting out the bins, I take the vitamin D pill. You could stack your weekly reflection time to the bin day. Or allocate it to do your weekly budget. Easy.\n\nNone of this is complicated. That's the point.\n\nThe mistake most people make is trying to stack five things at once. The other mistake is giving up after two weeks because it still feels forced. Give it one to two months before you judge. What I've noticed is that somewhere around the one month mark, you stop noticing the effort. That's when you know it's working. The habit has attached itself to the anchor, and now skipping it feels stranger than doing it.\n\nThe best part is that once one stack is solid, it becomes the anchor for the next. You stacked writing onto morning coffee? Now stack stock analysis onto writing. Now stack updating your watchlist onto that. One habit becomes a chain, and the chain becomes a morning routine you genuinely look forward to.\n\nPeople overcomplicate this stuff. You don't need a system. You don't need an app. You need one habit, one anchor, and about a month of showing up.\n\nStart with the thing that's been on your list the longest. The thing you keep meaning to do but never quite get to. Find the moment in your day where it fits most naturally, and just attach it.",

I\u2019ve also started meditating for five or so minutes.\n\nBut when I think of changing in general, I feel resistance.

    "selftext": "Vent dump first.\n\nFrom 14 to 17 I got bullied. I kept losing friends. I came out of school with basically zero social skills. I couldn\u2019t hold eye contact. I was a virgin. I heard people tell their friends I was ugly.\n\nThat\u2019s mi background.\n\nNow here\u2019s what I genuinely don\u2019t understand: I never hated myself.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not saying that to flex. I\u2019m trying to understand the mechanism. Because if you look at the \u201cingredients\u201d for self-hate, I had most of them. Social rejection. Status loss. Public humiliation. Isolation. That\u2019s usually the cocktail. But instead of internalizing it as \u201cI\u2019m trash,\u201d my brain went somewhere else.\n\nIt went: \u201cThey\u2019re judging me on shallow stuff. My core values are respect, empathy, honesty, introspection. If they\u2019re mocking me for not fitting some teenage hierarchy, that says more about their framework than about my worth.\u201d\n\nMaybe I got lucky. Maybe it\u2019s temperament. Maybe it\u2019s ego. I don\u2019t know.\n\nI also always saw school as temporary. A phase. Teenagers ranking each other based on looks and confidence levels isn\u2019t some objective thing. It\u2019s just\u2026 immature humans being immature humans. And immature systems expire.\n\nOn top of that, I separated things into two categories: what I can act on, and what I can\u2019t. If something was changeable \u2014 social skills, physique, grooming, posture, confidence \u2014 then it became a project.\n\nIf something wasn\u2019t changeable, then hating myself over it felt like burning fuel for nothing. To me, self-hate always seemed inefficient.\n\nIf I spend hours thinking \u201cI\u2019m ugly, I\u2019m behind, I\u2019m inferior,\u201d that\u2019s time and energy not invested into lifting, learning to talk to people, putting myself in uncomfortable reps. Why allocate it to something that doesn\u2019t produce movement?\n\nSo instead of collapsing inward, I went pragmatic.\n\nThree years ago I was the bullied kid who couldn\u2019t look anyone in the eyes.\n\nThis month I cold approached a girl at the mall and it went well.\n\nCouldn't have done it with self-hate in the way.\n\nWhich is why when people talk about self-hate, I\u2019m genuinely curious. Because in my head the script was always: This isn\u2019t fixed. This isn\u2019t permanent. And these people are not the final judges of who I am. \u201cI was bullied\u201d is not \u201cI am inferior.\u201d\n\n**Temporary position shouldn\u2019t gets stamped as a permanent trait.**\n\nRead that twice. It's life changing.\n\nYour brain is always on a narrative. If the narrative is \u201cThis is who I am,\u201d you\u2019re wrong. If the narrative is \u201cThis is where I currently am,\u201d you move.\n\nSo when I say \u201cit\u2019s in your head,\u201d I don\u2019t mean the pain is imaginary. The bullying was real. The feeling of looking ugly was real. The loneliness was real.\n\nBut the meaning attached to it? That part is constructed.\n\nAnd once you realize meaning is constructed, you realize it can be reconstructed.\n\nThat\u2019s the part I never lost. And maybe that\u2019s why I don't understand self-hate.",

For most people, it's around morning  \nLow energy zone: When you have less energy and focus, it's better to focus on simple stuff\n\nIf you have any notes to add to this, please go ahead",

Nobody really says it loud, but you can feel when ownership is kinda blurry.

Not because I don't care - I actually do - but the urgency disappears. This is because no one is with you to ping you that there is something to do, and you should do it.\n\n  \nAnd daily routine? That's a whole different story. My to-do list looks like it belongs to a different person by the time the day ends because the to-do list is static and does not tell me anything. \n\n\n\nWhere does accountability break for you the most - team projects, personal goals, or just everyday life? \n\n",

I\u2019ll know it\u2019s 11pm, I\u2019ll know I could wind down, and I\u2019ll consciously push it to 2 to 3am watching a series or doomscrolling.\n\nThe strange part is that I\u2019m not a slacker.

I wanted to do big things, make enough money to retire my parents. That was the dream.\n\nMy grades weren't bad. Above average in high school. My family \u2014 intellectual, loving, proud \u2014 hyped me up. But here's the honest truth: they didn't really understand how the world of money and opportunity works today. And because of that, I never had the privilege of knowing early on what I *should* have been building toward. I take responsibility for that too \u2014 a lot of people figure it out on their own, and I could have too.\n\nAfter high school, I got into a government engineering school. Never failed, but I lived on the edge of failing. What pushed me forward wasn't passion \u2014 it was fear of shame, the pressure not to disappoint. That was my fuel. And somehow, I made it through and got my degree.\n\nNot long after, I landed a job as a research engineer at a university laboratory. Prototyping, simulations \u2014 impressive stuff, at least to everyone in my small network. On paper, I was the hardworking kid who made it despite the challenges.\n\nThen came the twist. And I take full responsibility for it.\n\nLong story short \u2014 I showed up to work drunk. Security at the door noticed. In my state, I resisted a little. That was enough to get me fired. And honestly? I understood. It was my mistake. But what it revealed was something deeper \u2014 I wasn't happy. I had things building up inside me that I never dealt with. Instead of taking a vacation, processing it, healing \u2014 it exploded like that.\n\nRather than face the shame at home, I made a decision: I left the country. First time ever. My parents didn't even know until I was already gone. I packed my degree and my things and flew out, full of hope, convinced this was my moment to finally shine.\n\nThe shame came with me though. But I told myself \u2014 that's life, I have to move forward.\n\nAfter two months, I moved to South Korea, thinking I'd find something there. But the language barrier was brutal. With no other options, I worked manual labor for a while, then moved to Seoul looking for better opportunities. Eventually I landed a hotel cleaning and management job. And while I was there, studying how they handled their cleaning operations, something clicked in me \u2014 curiosity kicked in, a plan formed, and I built an app. A cleaning platform startup. The pitch deck tells that story.\n\nBut South Korea wasn't going to work out for me long-term. The second gap year had already started. Pressure was mounting. I moved to Thailand to try to make it work here.\n\nI applied to startup programs. Got rejected. The idea needs more work, more momentum \u2014 I know that. Remote jobs and engineering roles? The competition is brutal and the rejections keep coming.\n\nBut that's where I am. That's my story and my situation \u2014 honest, messy, and still in motion.\n\nI'm not looking for sympathy. Just honest, direct advice from people who've been in uncomfortable places and found a way through.",

And the day I lock in is the day I will outperform everyone.\u201d\n\nBut what\u2019s actually happening in the background is just coping. My brain is saying, \u201cIf we never try, we never truly risk disproving the self-image.\u201d\n\nIf I never go all in, my potential stays untested. And untested potential is very comfortable. It\u2019s infinite. It\u2019s undefeated.\n\nBut once I try for real, there is data. There is a scoreboard. There is proof. And that proof seems dangerous to the self-image.\n\nSo procrastination became protection. If I didn\u2019t put in the work, I didn\u2019t fail, I just didn\u2019t try.

Effort started feeling risky because struggle threatened the label.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHow I am planning to make things better:\n\nMy definition of \u201csmart\u201d is problematic. I am associating the word with \u201ceffortless brilliance.\u201d This is the core of the problem that needs to be fixed. The term \u201csmart\u201d needs to be redefined.\n\nThis starts by asking a simple question: What actually made people think I was smart in the first place?\n\nThe answer lies in my ability to map out my own mind with precision and recognize underlying patterns through self-observation. This is the superpower I was born with.\n\nUsing this superpower, all I need to do is make my brain believe that \u201csmart\u201d should instead be associated with fast learning, adaptability, and the capacity for deep work. I have to replace \u201cI am smart because I am capable of getting ahead of people\u201d with \u201cI am smart because I can stay consistent, determined, and focused.\u201d\n\nThis definition doesn\u2019t collapse when I struggle; it is actually proven through the struggle.\n\n\u00a0",

Remember, you are not what happens to you, but what you choose to become.'\n\n**Where Your Fear Is, There Is Your Task**\\- It\u2019s your duty to overcome your fears.  \n**Fear Is Always Subjective**\\- It exists only in your mind.  \n**Fear Is An Illusion**\\- It exists because you feed its existence.  \n**Fear Is A Parasite**\\- It can't live without you.  \n**Don\u2019t Be A Prisoner Of Your Fears**\\- Life driven by fears is miserable and painful.  \n**Name Your Fears**\\- Choose the first one to confront.  \n**Face Your Fears**\\- That is the best way to overcome them.  \n**Be Fearless**\\- You grow fearless by walking into your fears.  \n**Coward And Brave Are The Same. They Both Feel Fear**\\- But what separates them is the way they behave when they feel fear.   \n**Don\u2019t Tolerate Your Fears**\\- Conquer them before they grow and become bigger problems.\n\nThink back to your biggest growth\u2014did it happen in your comfort zone, or when you decided to face what scared you?",

It's easy to optimize your morning routine it's harder to ask why you feel empty when you are alone.\n\nIt's easy to track calories it's hard to examine why your self worth depends on how you look.\n\nIt's easy to read productivity books. It's harder to fix it quietly and question whether you even want the goals you're chasing.\n\nA lot of improvement culture focuses on control:\nControl your time,\nControl your emotions,\nControl your impulses, \nbut real growth might requires something else. Understanding.\n\nUnderstanding why you procrasinate, understanding where you get defensive understanding why certain commands or words trigger you, understanding what fear is protecting.\n\nSometimes laziness is not laziness. It's avoidance of possible failure, sometimes lack of motivation is not weakness. It's misalignment. Sometimes burnout is not incapability. It's s chasing goals that were never truly yours.\n\nWe rarely ask, are my goals authentically choosing, \nor are they socially inherited? \nAre my standards mine? \nOr are they borrowed from comparison?\n\nSelf improvement without self examination can turn into a sophisticated form of self escape.\nYou become better at performing a version of yourself; without understanding who that self actually is. \nMaybe improvement is not about becoming someone new. Maybe it's about removing distortions, questioning assumptions, revising narratives, separating fear from fact.\n\nI'm curious. When was the last time you realized? The problem wasn't disciplined, but misunderstanding.\nWhat part of self improvement culture do you think people rarely question?\n\nWould love to hear different perspectives.",

    "selftext": "This is a post designed to *offer* hope.\n\nI often see posts with individuals asking how to start with discipline, what happens when they lose their streak, what does it mean if they take a break and come back - and other queries and concerns about discipline in the context of life that  . . . changes.\n\nSo! I have always considered discipline to be a valuable personal quality, much like others in this sub, but have spent much time judging and getting down on myself for falling short of my desired standard.\n\nThen last week, something crazy happened.\n\nA friend said to me, they were explaining to their friend (who is an acquaintance of mine) how responsible I am. As in, \"psykedelique is so responsible, they always know how much electricity they're using and how much they need to budget, they even make grocery lists and plan cleaning and stuff.\"\n\nMy initial reaction was that I have these skills out of necessity - limited income leaves you with no choice but to budget.\n\nBut then I realised - *I didn't always have these skills.*\n\n*I spent years struggling because I made poor financial choices, despite having no financial wriggle-room. I  didn't clean, because I couldn't figure out when to do it or how to go about it. And I had no idea what was happening day to day.*\n\n**I made gradual changes.** The gradual part wasn't deliberate - I knew what I wanted to do. I just *really* struggled to do those things consistently.\n\nOver the years, I have been provided with opportunities to streamline my cleaning processes. Knowing what works for me really helps. Forgiving myself when I don't achieve to my ideal standard also helps.\n\nFinancial discipline doesn't come easily. When you have very little, overspending in one area by as little as $2 can completely throw your entire week's budget. And yeah, I don't get it perfect - but I learned to prioritise.\n\nI'm now 37, and my peer group . . . sees me as both responsible and disciplined.\n\n**So I want to say to you all,** ***keep going!***  Right now, you might not feel like your level of discipline is improving or increasing. It turns out that cultivating discipline is one of those tricky things that can only be truly appreciated in hindsight.\n\nYour journey to becoming more disciplined is likely going much better than you think it is.\n\nThank you for your time. :)",

Suprisingly, I've done really well on tests and things that are fast, but I've always struggled with essays, projects, presentations in high school. I think its because it doesn't leave me room to think and tests are highly structured and I've always been able to learn things fast. I decided to choose a design program in university though because I wanted to follow my interests, not necessarily what I was naturally good at, though I've always been artistic and creative. Anything that requires a large breadth of information, a lot of flexibility, and a lot of organization, I've always struggled with. I find that I think in circles and I'm indecisive. I want to fix this problem. I start an idea but abandon it and I feel lost. I've been able to researrch in the past and its when I'm absolutely certain about my topic. There's so much friction between me and the task. Even if there is a deadline, it can't motivate me, until maybe the last minute or external pressure. I'm often really creative, but I think the stress from school prevents me from accessing the flow state. The times I'm super productive is when the instructions are super clear and or I'm passionate, know from the get go what I wanted to do. I'm learning to sit with emotions and to see everything as an exploration. But I've had this issue since first year of university. I am diagnosed with generalized anxiety. Does anyone have advice on how to combat this issue? I feel like its a toxic cycle of shame, I'm trying to be more compassionate to myself and remind myself that this assignment is small and I'll forget about it. I have issues with perfectionism, I know I need to do a lot of inner work. I've always felt inadequate and I realized that this is rooted in childhood experiences of feeling rejected and isolated when I wasn't 'perfect' and I attached my worth to my accomplishments. When I get into these ruts I tend to not feel present and I tend to feel very burnt out at the end.",

Im failing functions but I used to be called a math-wiz when I was a kid. Subjects I know would take little effort to get a good mark in, I procrastinate and barely pass. Thats if my teachers are lucky that I even show up to class. Some days I wake up late and skip the first couple periods. Some days I wake up on time, get ready, fall into lust, or scroll, or do some fuck shit (way too fucking early in the morning) and disappoint and feel bad for myself that I skip the whole day. This lead to me being behind on school subjects and digging a whole deeper than I was already in. Deep to the point I think I should\u2019ve stayed in 10th grade. \n\nBesides school, sometimes even the easiest things I can\u2019t do. I procrastinate doing the dishes, I haven\u2019t done laundry for weeks now. And I don\u2019t even wanna start with being fat. \n\nThe thing is, I know what to. How to improve.\n\nI can delete tiktok, skip out on a meal, do homework and I even catch myself realizing mid-goon that I should stop.\n\nBut I don\u2019t.\n\nI choose to scroll, keep eating the calorie-dense meal, play games and keep gripping instead of stopping and doing homework.\n\nAnd then I disappoint myself. I feel like my days ruined, and then im in a whole deeper than I was. Fatter, farther behind school, the whole nine yards.\n\nI think deep down, I don\u2019t want it bad enough. I look at myself and I think I\u2019ve gotten comfortable at being a failure. \n\nWhen I know I should be doing things I know will help my future self, I don\u2019t do jt, because im scared of the outcome that I\u2019ll be in a place worse than before. \n\nLike im scared of failing.\n\nBut I know how to solve even that.\n\n\u201cWhy be scared of failing if it hasn\u2019t even happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhats the worst that could happen?\u201d\n\nI know, and I wish I could answer that aswell.\n\nI want to live a good life.\n\nI wanna give my parents the life they deserve.\n\nI want to be proud of myself.\n\nBut I\u2019m also fine with not fulfilling those.\n\nI think thats my problem.\n\nIm so fucking used to failure\n\nI get stuck in a cycle of failure and disappointment and repeat that so many times that I got used to it.\n\nFuck\n\nMy grandma passed a couple months ago.\n\nShe raised me because my mom was away overseas for better money.\n\nWhen I got reunited with my mom overseas, I chose to not talk to my grandmother as much. I regret that alot.\n\nI was such a bright kid, she taught me my multiplication tables when she brushed my teeth, sang my abcs with her when she put my clothes on. I was top 3 smartest student in my whole region of my city because of her. She probably thought ill achieve far more than that. Even on her deathbed, she probably thought the best of me. Look at me now.\n\nIm scared I would never be able to honour her and live up to her expectations. Or maybe expectations of myself I thought she would have of me. \n\nEverytime the cycle happens, everyday, I prove that thought right. And I\u2019m getting comfortable being fine with that.\n\nI hate it.\n\nPlease help me change before it\u2019s too late.\n\nTldr: I don\u2019t do anything productive that will help me improve because im scared of failing \u2014&gt; feel bad for myself because I don\u2019t even start \u2014&gt; getting used to failure \u2014&gt; not being able to do easy tasks \u2014&gt; \ud83d\udd01",

And weirdly, that changes everything.\n\nThe idea isn\u2019t \u201cmore productivity tips\u201d, It\u2019s social pressure + real-time competition.\n\nDo you work better this way too?",

I Improved my life after that, only to be stagnant the past several years at a dead end job that I ended up quitting after spending nearly a decade studying for it. I ended up burning out, struggling to manage work and life commitments etc. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do with myself. It\u2019s been 4 months since I stopped working, I feel like I\u2019ve caught up on my years of lack of sleep but I\u2019m still tired. I take ADHD medication, but even then I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s working. I\u2019ve been on these meds for a long time and it only works as a stimulant at this point. \n\nBut the issues I\u2019m having is, what do I do and where do I start. I feel as though I burnt myself out to the point I just want to lie in bed all day and do nothing but that depresses me even more and then I get overwhelmed with deciding what to do with my life. I find my energy dynamic which isn\u2019t always helpful. I know I have potential, I\u2019m creative etc but again what do I do with this. How do I find my passions? Am I too old for this (I know I\u2019m not but it feels like it). \n\nI don\u2019t trust my ADHD to be responsible for me, I need to get disciplined in a way that it doesn\u2019t burn me out and I think there\u2019s a fine line. I know I need to exercise, I know I need to eat healthier but even going food shopping just feels like I am dragging myself through thorn bushes. \n\nI don\u2019t want to feel like this anymore, I want to be a better version of me but it\u2019s like I intellectually know what to do but there is a huge resistance to do anything. I also don\u2019t know how to work with my adhd, because what does the energy depend on? Sleep? Food? Just random? I can\u2019t live like this forever, I want to be consistent. I\u2019m exhausted all the time and need to get out of this rut. \n\nI hope there\u2019s someone like me that has been able to work with their ADHD for them. I don\u2019t want to use my ADHD as an excuse for the way I am, but it sure does affect me. I appreciate your opinions thank you.",

Removing the convenience of these apps from my phone prevented me from browsing when I am bored and ordering takeout. Amazon was the biggest problem for me, but if there is something I really need then I will go to the website and order it straight away then close the tab to remove the urge to browse.\n\n**2. Replaced price tag for time tag**\n\nWhen I look at the price of something at a store, I ask \"how long would I have to work to recuperate this money?\". This helps me calculate the \"value\" of the item. So if a designer pair of shoes cost $500, I know if I buy this I would have to work 34 hours of my life just to make that money back. This strategy helps me evaluate how important an item actually is to me, and helped me save a good amount of money.\n\n**3. Downloading useful apps**\n\nThere are a bunch of budgeting apps out there that can help you put your money habits into perspective. I like Pawket because it focuses on building healthier habits with budgeting tools on the side. It is also slightly encouraging since it uses a pet to keep me coming back to the app and focus on my goals/building habits. Other apps take a more boring/serous approach with spreadsheets and boxes to enter transactions, etc. Apps like You Need a Budget and Copilot are good for the serious approach if that's what you need, and they do still have nice features.",

But at the same time, I\u2019ve struggled with confidence issues and anxiety.\n\nI was at it for a while, then had to take a break for personal reasons. Now I\u2019m back at it again. The whole process has been going on for more than a year. Even though I feel like I\u2019ve learned a lot and gotten significantly better at interviews, I\u2019m feeling more depressed than ever about restarting the process.\n\nI\u2019m in a very fast-moving tech industry, and it feels like the world is moving ahead without me. It\u2019s hard to keep pace with everything, preparing for interviews, actively applying, doing a full-time job (which is also not very chill), maintaining my health, and making sure I have enough energy to keep going.\n\nI do try to work out regularly, for instance, 2\u20133 strength training sessions a week, and walking or running on the remaining days. But sometimes my depression takes over, and I\u2019m unable to stick to routines or maintain a regular sleep schedule. I\u2019m also in therapy once every two weeks, sometimes weekly.\n\nI consider myself a very ambitious person, and the longer these interviews drag on, the more worthless I feel, like I\u2019m not good enough to land my dream roles. A part of me strongly believes that with enough prep, I can achieve my goals. But my depression gets in the way and affects my energy and consistency. Sometimes I feel pathetic because it all sounds like such a big excuse. \n\nI have a huge tendency to compare my life to others and I feel like most my peers who started the process along with me have moved onto to better opportunities. I also feel very alone lately because none of my friends seem to care or ask about my whereabouts or well being. I know this is a very self-sabotaging tendency, but I tend to feel that my friends don't care about me. I'm really fed up of being in this state.\n\nWhat can I do to get out of this funk?",

Eating for satiety, not for joy, during the loss phase.\n* **1 Movement:**\u00a0A non-negotiable 20-rep \"floor.\" If you don't feel like it, you do 5. But you must start. Usually, starting is enough to get the 20 done.\n\nThe goal is\u00a0**Adherence-Focused Progression**. We don't care about miles or calories yet; we care about the streak. By making the \"floor\" so low, it becomes impossible to fail, even on your worst days.\n\nI'm curious - for those of you who have struggled with consistency, what is the \"minimum\" habit that actually stuck for you?",

In other words, make sure you hit these two things before trying pomodoro, time blocking, prioritization or anything like this. It's not that these things don't help, they just might not be solving the real problem\n\nThe two things I've found to check off first are:\n\n1. Are my physical / mental / emotional boxes checked? Is my mind clear when I sit down to work? Do I feel like I have the natural energy to get through more challenging tasks I have?\n\nI used to go into days feeling like crap, so I found a system for keeping track of these background elements that play into my productivity so much.\n\nThat helped me devise routines outside of work to make sure my work hours were strong (and less were required). Some of those things are (obvious) sleep, healthy meals, exercise and (not so obvious) sending a text to a friend, stretching, and jumping in the cold plunge. It's not about when I do them, just having them in my life improves the quality of my focus.\n\n2. Do I care about what I'm working on? I used to work at a tech company, and I didn't care about my work. Weirdly, I still wanted to be a \"good\" employee, but I just could not find it in me to care about the work itself.\n\nThat resulted in years of extremely low output. I tried all the techniques. Without a true, visceral desire to do something, it's going to be hard to \"hack\" yourself into doing it well.\n\nI've been working on my own project for 6 months now, free of an employer (really just unemployed, which sounds way worse), and I've never had so much energy.\n\nOnce I dial those two key pieces in (but not before), I feel better about trying techniques and optimizing even past that. It's a classic 80/20 situation, where many people (myself included, in the past) focus on things that will provide marginal improvements while there is an existing fundamental issue.",

I'm not sure if anyone can relate, but I just cannot bring myself to do anything for myself. I'm a college student, and although I have the pieces of the puzzle in front of me, I cannot do the work. I need to take my MCAT test, and just finish preparing my med school application so I can apply. It got so bad last year that I straight up delayed everything until I had no choice but to wait till this year. I'm great at doing things for others, helping out, etc. But when it comes to my own life, it's like I don't exist. Some days I just sit in my room and dissociate, waiting for the day to be over. I want to fight this funk permanently, because it's been slowly destroying my life, and I've lost almost all my friends, professional connections, and self-motivation because of it. I know that I have potential, but I'm sincerely stuck. I appreciate anyone who was able to simply read and beyond - wishing you all great rest of your week.",

Some comments conflict with each other. Some are about things I already explained in the initial post but they didn't read it.\n\nThen I need to synthesize all the feedback, figure out what's actually important vs nice to have, make changes, repost for approval. Except now different stakeholders respond at different times so I'm getting feedback trickling in over days. Meanwhile I've context switched to other work so every time feedback arrives I need to re-familiarize myself with what this design was even about.\n\nThe async nature of Slack means feedback never feels complete. There's no clear point where I can say \"okay I have all the feedback, time to iterate.\" Just a slow drip of comments that might stop or might continue, who knows. So I'm in this constant state of uncertainty about whether to wait for more feedback or just move forward.\n\nCompare this to in-person design reviews where you present, everyone gives feedback in the same 30 minutes, you leave knowing exactly what to do next. Slack should be better because it's async but somehow it's worse because there's no structure or closure.",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone! So i am a 22 year old man and i deeply struggle with procrastination for the past 3 years. When i became 17 i was already struggling with a bit of depression and stress which was escalating in my life. I was really worried about my future self ( i know that was stupid ) and the pinnacle, the peak of the whole thing happened when my math teacher beat me ( for real) because i didnt solve an equation right. But the true reason he did it was the fact that he was jealous at my success at math cause i started studying( not college or uni yet, prior to college) at 16 being completely a beginner and 2 years later i was the best in my class.\n\nHe later confessed to my mother that he really envied me and that was the true reason he did it- to lower my self- esteem , make me feel bad. In the end, he achieved his goal. As an extremely sensitive teenager, and as I mentioned, I had already begun to struggle with stress and sadness, I lost everything. I respected that man, the math teacher, he was like a hero to me. He was the one who taught me math, made me a better student, changed my life . After that, all the good things I thought about him went out the window. And along with that, I stopped studying and started playing video games all day again. Video games were my refuge. They eased my pain and helped me forget. I remember the next day I opened my physics book and couldn't read. I can't explain it. I had a burnout.\n\nAnd I know what you're thinking. What the hell? What a snowflake that guy is. How is it possible to give up on everything just because a professor failed him? But that's who I was back then, and that can't change. The thing is, three years later, I'm still doing the same things. I am a terrible university student. I owe almost all my courses.\n\nFor the past three years, I kept saying to myself, \"Tomorrow,\" and I never do anything. I observe the people that belong at the same age group as me and i see them getting ahead in life and one part of me is proud of them, and the other one is jealous at them because i know that i have the potential and the capabilities to do the same as them and even better but i am stuck in this loop and i cant see a way out of it. Do any of you have the same problem with procrastination? And if so, how do you deal with it? What advice would you give me? Thank you all in advance.",

    "selftext": "I've tried everything to stay consistent with self-improvement. Habit trackers, accountability partners, motivational quotes on my wall even. Nothing lasted more than 3 weeks.\u00a0 I honestly started feeling incapable / not meant for it.\n\nThe problem wasn't discipline. It was that I kept forgetting I was actually making progress.\n\nHere's what I mean:\n\nI start strong. First week, I hit the gym 4 times, meal prep Sunday, wake up at 6 AM. I feel unstoppable.\n\nWeek 3, I miss a workout. Then two. I sleep in one day. Suddenly I feel like I'm \"falling off\" and the voice in my head says \"see, you always do this.\" FUCK.\n\nBut here's the thing: I'm not actually back at zero. I just forgot about the 15 workouts I crushed, the 12 early mornings, the week I stuck to my meal plan perfectly.\n\nThe human brain has a negativity bias. Turns out we remember the misses way more than the wins. So even when we are objectively progressing, it feels like we're failing.\n\n# What changed for me:\n\nI started keeping a \"Win Log.\"\n\nEvery single day, I write down 1-3 things I actually did. Not what I planned to do. Not what I \"should\" have done. Just what I actually executed on.\n\nSome examples from my log:\n\n* \"Went to gym even though I felt like shit\"\n* \"Had a hard conversation with my gay brother I'd been avoiding\"\n* \"Didn't doom scroll for 2 hours before bed\"\n* \"Followed through on my morning routine\"\n* \"Applied to 3 jobs\"\n\n# Why this works:\n\n**1. You create evidence.**\n\nWhen your brain tells you \"you're not capable,\" you have a list proving otherwise. On day 32, when I wanted to quit, I scrolled through my log and saw 31 days of proof that I\u00a0*can*\u00a0execute. That's not motivation.\u00a0 That\u2019s fucking data.\n\n**2. You break the amnesia cycle.**\n\nMost people only remember the last 3 days of their journey. Everything before that is fuzzy. The Win Log makes your progress tangible. You can literally see how far you've come. This creates an infinite loop where your wins fuel your actions, which then fuel your wins, which then fuel your actions..\u00a0 So you\u2019re naturally able to just keep going\n\n**3. It reframes \"bad\" days.**\n\nEven on days I felt like I failed, I could usually find 1-2 small wins. \"Didn't work out, but I did drink 2L of water and got 7 hours of sleep.\" Literally didn\u2019t fail.\n\n# The rule I follow:\n\nLog at least 1 win per day. No matter what.\n\nEven if it's \"I got out of bed.\" Even if it's \"I didn't give up.\" Something.\n\nBecause here's the truth: you're probably doing way better than you think. You're just not keeping score.\n\nYour wins are fuel. But only if you remember them.\n\n**TLDR:**\u00a0Started logging daily wins instead of tracking habits. Turns out I wasn't failing, I just had amnesia about my progress. When you feel like quitting, concrete evidence of past execution is way more powerful than motivation.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nJust to clarify how this is different from a habit tracker:\u00a0**Habits feel like obligation. Wins are evidence of capability.**\u00a0One creates pressure, the other creates confidence through proof\n\nPeople asked what I use:\u00a0 It\u2019s *CTRL \u2013 Self Improvement OS*. The Win Log is just one feature, but it\u2019s the one that fiiiinally made me consistent.",

    "selftext": "For context I\u2018m 19 and i\u2018d say that I generally am in a pretty good place, I go to the gym 5 times a week and study somewhat advanced mathematics, engineering mechanics and thermodynamics for my mechanical engineering degree. Since I started trying to fix myself I kinda always fell into that spiral of hating myself to the point that I feel like I have to do something because I\u2018m going to end up fat again and if I don\u2019t study more I\u2018m going to be homeless etc. I recently started noticing that after years of this I\u2018m absolutely drained and I couldn\u2019t appreciate myself for nothing and didn\u2019t want other people to point out that I\u2018m doing fine and just have to stay on that trajectory, since I felt like I didn\u2019t deserve nice words ir anything like that. In short: I tried to hate myself more every day just to have something to \u201efight\u201c which ended up being myself instead of really working towards my goals. Now thankfully I\u2019m at least in a bit of a better place mentally and try to give myself some credit for what I do and generally try to be kinder to myself.\n\n Unfortunately there are still some days where I just don\u2019t perform even though it\u2019s not like I have much else to do and I feel like I don\u2019t have any drive whatsoever without my selfhatred, so my question is how can I push myself more without throwing myself back into that spiral? (Not only in the gym but also in my studies) I feel like sometimes I\u2018m just doing less that I realistically could\u2019ve and I don\u2019t know what it is, I genuinely enjoy science and sports but I feel like I\u2018m just lazy sometimes.\n\nPlease be as harsh as you have to be\n\nMuch appreciated ",

My guardians think they\u2019re great for providing the basics, but their judgment and 'help' literally delayed my education for years(family drama, actually ) Now I\u2019m stuck in this loop of feeling that I should be grateful to them for providing me shelter, food, free internet, a room, taking me out sometimes and the feeling of delayed education, lack of freedom, lack of choice.\n\nI tried to look for a way out on the CS subreddits and got absolutely cooked. Some people said I\u2019ll never catch up to 23-year-old grads because they\u2019ll always have more experience. I don't know, the only interests I have except for art is the love of understanding how things work and why, i thought CS would be a good major and there are lots of books and courses online but I am not sure anymore. I was passionate in arts and i still draw but it's not where near the level of my other artists, as I kid(young teen) I wanted to become a concept designer in gaming industry.\n\nI tried looking for any kind of job nearby but my gaurdian won't allow that( part time job are for the people who are poor, why you want to work when we are providing is what they told me. It's a bad mindset i know but I can't argue with them, working part time in my country was never a Norm)\n\nEvery day I wake up, go through my routine to do math practice, drawing, exercise and just helping my guardian in the kitchen or washing clothes or any other work they might have. I've been living like this for the last 5 years now.\n\nI just want to wake up and not regret being conscious. I somehow managed to pass my 10th grade school through open school this year and I am preparing for my 12th grade exams next year. We have tons of options to choose from (the subjects you wanna take, like CS, economics etc) I have no degree, and I\u2019m terrified that I'll never be enough for anything. \n\n\n",

I\u2019m also curious if this pattern is common for adults who used to focus well in school.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice.",

The idea was simple but powerful: most of what we experience as \u201cpain\u201d during physical challenges is driven by the mind. Our brains often tell us to stop long before our bodies truly need to. If we learn to sit with that discomfort instead of reacting to it, we can push ourselves further than we think.\n\nWith that in mind, I\u2019m starting a 31-day plank challenge today \u2014 not just to strengthen my body, but to train my mindset and improve my emotional regulation.\n\nMy starting point ----&gt; 3 minutes and 48 seconds.\n\nChallenge Rules: \n\n1. Hold a plank for at least 3.5 minutes and aim to improve by 5 seconds each session.\n\n2.No music or distractions.. stay fully present and sit with the discomfort.\n\n3.Practice body scanning to observe where I feel tension, shaking, or resistance. And hold it with breathing in and out\n\n4.Remind myself that the pain is temporary and Once the plank ends, the discomfort fades..but the mental strength remains.\n\nI\u2019ll journal my progress daily and share updates along the way.\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "I realized I hadn\u2019t been genuinely bored in over five years.\n\nEvery single second of potential boredom had an instant solution. Waiting in line, pull out phone. Sitting on the toilet, scroll TikTok. Eating alone, watch YouTube. Lying in bed, browse Reddit. I\u2019d engineered my entire life so boredom was impossible.\n\nI\u2019m 27. For the past five years I\u2019d been filling every gap in my day with stimulation. Not because I wanted to consume all that content, but because I couldn\u2019t handle the feeling of having nothing to do.\n\nStanding in line at the grocery store for three minutes felt unbearable without my phone. Sitting in a waiting room felt like torture. Any moment where I wasn\u2019t actively doing something, my hand automatically reached for my phone to fill the void.\n\nI thought I was just being efficient with my time. Turns out I\u2019d completely destroyed my brain\u2019s ability to handle boredom and it was ruining everything.\n\nMy creativity was dead. I hadn\u2019t had an original thought in years because my brain never had space to wander. My attention span was destroyed. I couldn\u2019t focus on anything difficult because the second it got hard or boring, I\u2019d escape to my phone.\n\nI couldn\u2019t sit through a movie without scrolling. Couldn\u2019t have a conversation without checking notifications. Couldn\u2019t read a book for more than five minutes. My brain had been trained that boredom was an emergency that needed immediate solving.\n\nTwo months ago I was sitting in a doctor\u2019s waiting room scrolling Instagram and I realized I\u2019d been there for 20 minutes and couldn\u2019t remember a single post I\u2019d seen. Just mindless scrolling to avoid sitting there with nothing to do.\n\nThat\u2019s when it hit me. I was terrified of boredom. And that fear was preventing me from ever thinking deeply, being creative, or being present. I needed to relearn how to be bored.\n\nWhat I actually did\n\nRemoved every boredom escape\n\nDay one I deleted everything I used to avoid boredom. Every social media app, every mobile game, YouTube, Reddit, news apps, all of it gone.\n\nPut my phone on grayscale so even looking at it was less appealing. Removed it from my bedroom so I couldn\u2019t scroll in bed.\n\nFound this app called Reload through some productivity forum. Used it to block all entertainment sites and social media on my laptop and phone. Also blocked the App Store so I couldn\u2019t reinstall my boredom killers.\n\nThe goal was simple: make avoiding boredom impossible so I had to sit with it.\n\nForced boring situations daily\n\nThe plan Reload built required me to put myself in boring situations every single day and just sit with it. No phone, no distractions, just boredom.\n\nWeek one: sit in a park for 20 minutes doing absolutely nothing. No book, no phone, just sitting.\n\nWeek two: take a 30 minute walk with no music, no podcast, nothing. Just walking and being bored.\n\nWeek three and beyond: increase the boredom exposure until my brain could handle it.\n\nRemoved all background stimulation\n\nI\u2019d been filling every activity with secondary stimulation. Listening to podcasts while cooking. Watching YouTube while eating. Music during every car ride.\n\nRemoved all of it. Everything I did, I did with zero entertainment. Cooking in silence. Eating with no screen. Driving with no audio. Pure boredom during every formerly distracted moment.\n\nBanned phone use in certain situations\n\nNo phone while waiting for anything. Waiting in line, waiting rooms, waiting for food, whatever. Just stand there and be bored.\n\nNo phone during meals ever. Just eat and be bored.\n\nNo phone in bed at all. If I couldn\u2019t sleep I had to lie there bored, not scroll.\n\nThese rules made avoiding boredom impossible. I had to face it constantly.\n\nWeek 1 boredom felt like dying\n\nFirst week was absolutely brutal. My brain went into panic mode every time it got bored.\n\nDay 1 I sat in a park for 20 minutes doing nothing. Made it maybe 4 minutes before the restlessness became overwhelming. My brain was screaming for stimulation. Checked my watch every 30 seconds. Those 20 minutes felt like hours.\n\nDay 2 I waited in line at the coffee shop without my phone. Three minute wait felt eternal. My hand kept reaching for my pocket out of habit. Had to physically keep my arms at my sides to stop myself.\n\nDay 3 I ate lunch with no phone or TV. Just me and food. Felt so uncomfortable I almost couldn\u2019t finish eating. My brain didn\u2019t know what to do with the boredom.\n\nDay 5 I tried to take a 30 minute walk with no podcast. Made it 10 minutes before I almost turned back. The silence and boredom felt unbearable. Forced myself to finish.\n\nDay 7 I sat in a waiting room for 15 minutes with no phone. Looked around at everyone else scrolling. Felt like the only person not solving the boredom problem. Those 15 minutes felt longer than the entire day.\n\nWeek one I realized how dependent I\u2019d become on constant stimulation. Couldn\u2019t handle even a few minutes of boredom without genuine distress.\n\nWeek 2 to 3 my brain started adjusting\n\nWeeks two and three the constant boredom exposure started changing something.\n\nDay 10 I sat in the park for 25 minutes. Still uncomfortable but I didn\u2019t check my watch every 30 seconds. My brain was slowly accepting that boredom wasn\u2019t an emergency.\n\nDay 12 I took a 40 minute walk with no audio. My mind started wandering instead of just panicking about the boredom. Had actual thoughts instead of just craving stimulation.\n\nWeek three I increased the boredom exposure. 30 minutes sitting doing nothing. Hour long walks. Entire meals in silence. My brain fought it less each time.\n\nDay 18 I had my first original idea in probably two years. Was walking in silence and my mind wandered to a problem I\u2019d been stuck on and suddenly I saw the solution. Would\u2019ve never happened if I\u2019d been listening to a podcast.\n\nDay 21 I waited 10 minutes in line and didn\u2019t even think about my phone. Just stood there. The boredom was present but not unbearable. My brain had started accepting it.\n\nWeek 4 to 6 boredom became productive\n\nWeeks four through six something shifted completely. Boredom stopped feeling like torture and started feeling like space.\n\nDay 25 I sat doing nothing for 45 minutes and my mind went to interesting places. Thought through a career decision I\u2019d been avoiding. Planned out a project I wanted to start. My brain was using the boredom productively instead of panicking.\n\nDay 30 I took an hour walk with no audio and came back with three pages of notes. My mind had wandered through problems, ideas, creative thoughts. All because I gave it space to be bored.\n\nWeek five the boredom became something I looked forward to. Those moments of nothing became when my best thinking happened.\n\nDay 35 I was waiting 20 minutes for an appointment and just sat there thinking. Didn\u2019t feel restless or uncomfortable. The boredom felt natural and my brain filled it with useful thoughts instead of panic.\n\nWeek six I was sitting doing nothing for an hour daily. Not meditating, just being bored and letting my mind wander wherever it wanted. That hour became the most valuable part of my day.\n\nDay 42 I had more creative ideas in one week than I\u2019d had in the previous year. My brain finally had space to think instead of just consuming.\n\nWeek 7 to 8 complete transformation\n\nLast two weeks my relationship with boredom completely changed.\n\nDay 50 I sat for 90 minutes doing absolutely nothing and it felt easy. My mind wandered through thoughts, solved problems, created ideas. The boredom was productive.\n\nWeek eight I could sit in any boring situation without reaching for my phone. Waiting rooms, lines, whatever. Just stood there comfortable with the boredom.\n\nI was taking two hour walks with no audio and loving it. My mind would work through things, connect ideas, be creative. All because I gave it space to be bored.\n\nDay 60 I realized I could focus on difficult tasks for hours. When the work got boring or hard, I didn\u2019t immediately escape to my phone. I could sit with the difficulty because my brain could handle boredom now.\n\nWhat actually changed in 60 days\n\nMy creativity came back\n\nHadn\u2019t had original ideas in years because my brain never had space to wander. Two months of forced boredom and ideas were flowing constantly.\n\nMy attention span recovered completely\n\nCould focus on difficult tasks for hours without needing stimulation. Could read books, watch movies, have conversations, all without reaching for my phone.\n\nMy problem solving improved dramatically\n\nBest solutions came during bored moments when my mind could wander. Walking with no podcast, sitting doing nothing, that\u2019s when breakthrough thoughts happened.\n\nI became present in my life\n\nStopped filling every moment with consumption. Actually experienced moments instead of distracting through them.\n\nI stopped fearing empty time\n\nBoredom went from feeling like an emergency to feeling like valuable space. I actively sought it out instead of avoiding it.\n\nMy mental clarity improved massively\n\nConstant stimulation had created constant mental noise. Boredom created space for clear thinking.\n\nWhat I learned about boredom\n\nModern life has made boredom feel unbearable. We\u2019re trained to solve it immediately with our phones.\n\nYour brain needs boredom to function properly. Creativity, deep thinking, problem solving, all of it requires mental space that boredom provides.\n\nConstant stimulation destroys your ability to focus. Your brain gets addicted to novelty and can\u2019t handle anything difficult or boring.\n\nThe moments you\u2019re most desperate to escape boredom are often when your brain would do its best thinking if you let it.\n\nYou can\u2019t think deeply while constantly consuming other people\u2019s thoughts. You need empty space for your own thoughts to emerge.\n\nBoredom is a skill. Modern people have lost it completely because they\u2019ve never had to develop it.\n\nIf you can\u2019t handle being bored\n\nNotice when you reach for your phone to escape boredom. What situation triggered it? Waiting, silence, lack of stimulation?\n\nDelete your boredom escape apps for one week. Social media, mobile games, news apps, whatever you use to avoid boredom.\n\nForce yourself into boring situations daily. Sit somewhere for 15 minutes doing nothing. Walk for 30 minutes with no audio. Just be bored.\n\nUse tools that prevent escaping. I used Reload to block everything and make avoiding boredom impossible. When you can\u2019t escape you\u2019re forced to adjust.\n\nRemove background entertainment from activities. Cook in silence. Eat without screens. Drive without podcasts. Experience the boredom.\n\nGive it 30 days minimum. First week is brutal. Week two you adjust. Week four boredom becomes productive.\n\nLet your mind wander during boredom instead of fighting it. That\u2019s when the best thinking happens.\n\nFinal thought\n\nI spent five years avoiding boredom every single second. Couldn\u2019t sit in silence for three minutes without reaching for my phone.\n\nSpent 60 days forcing myself to be bored constantly and my brain completely transformed.\n\nTurns out boredom isn\u2019t the enemy. It\u2019s necessary. My creativity, focus, and clarity all came back when I stopped filling every moment with stimulation.\n\nYou\u2019re probably avoiding boredom constantly too. Reaching for your phone the second you feel unstimulated. Filling every silence with content.\n\nStop escaping. Sit with the boredom. Let your brain have space to actually think.\n\nThe version of you that can handle boredom is more creative, focused, and present than the version constantly stimulated.\n\nStart today.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b",

On office days (which are most weekdays), I'm naturally active, easily clocking 7-8k steps just from commuting, walking around the workplace, and my post-work gym session. That feels manageable and keeps my energy up. But on non-office days like weekends or holidays, my step count plummets. Crossing even 500 steps feels like a massive effort.\n\nDiet-wise, I'm not a big eater. I stick to just 2 meals a day usually a solid breakfast/lunch combo and dinner, with no real snacking in between (maybe the occasional coffee or tea, but nothing caloric). My water intake is decent; I aim for 2-3 liters spread out. Sleep averages 6-7 hours per night, which I thought was okay, but maybe it's not cutting it for recovery or fat loss. Despite all this, the scale keeps creeping up, and I suspect my portions in those two meals might be larger than I realize, or maybe I'm not hitting enough protein to preserve muscle while in a sneaky surplus.\n\nMy goal is straightforward: drop down to at least 78-80 kg over the next 3-6 months in a sustainable way losing fat, keeping my gym strength gains, and building better habits without crash dieting or burnout. I need practical, realistic advice tailored to an Indian lifestyle maybe calorie tracking tips, step hacks for lazy days, meal ideas that fit 2-3 meals, or tweaks to my gym routine for better fat burn.\n\nWhat worked for you in similar situations? Apps, diet swaps, motivation tricks, or even accountability partners? Any warnings from your own journeys? Thanks in advance and looking forward to your insights to get back on track!\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "I used to believe I just needed more willpower to stop doomscrolling. When I clocked my phone usage at 8+\u202fhours a day, I realised discipline had to be smarter than that. I tested three approaches:\n\n**1. Delete the temptations.** I removed social and news apps. It worked for a bit, but soon I was doomscrolling in my browser. Without a clear plan, deletion wasn\u2019t sustainable.\n\n**2. Restrict and grayscale.** I turned my phone grayscale and set time\u2011of\u2011day blocks. It created some boundaries, but when I was stressed or bored, I bypassed them and binged.\n\n**3. Build a habit interrupter.** The only method that lasted was using an app that forces me to pause and reflect before opening a distracting app. That tiny friction engages my conscious brain and gives me a chance to choose something aligned with my goals. My screen time dropped from over 8\u202fhours to under 2, and I used the extra hours to train, study and rest.\n\nTakeaway: Discipline isn\u2019t about gritting your teeth; it\u2019s about designing systems that make good choices easier. A mindful pause was the missing piece.",

    "selftext": "I have acquired a form of discipline. I study every day, i clean my house ,i read what i want and I do drawing exercises every day. However, things have Gotten to a bad point with regards to the First. The habit of studying has got to a point i cannot feel fine quitting early to Go to rest, and when i mean early i mean at 7 pm or soo to shower and Go draw something, instead i end up dragging on studying more and more, trying to see Just one more subject or one more page, to feel less guilty in a way, that i Studied more or whatever . The result is that something that should have finished by 7 pm at best ends at 10 pm. Yes, its effective for the exams i deal with, no, its not healty and I feel its slowly draining my Will to live, as i sit down to draw and do funn stuff by 11 pm/midnight, and by them i have no energy for anything anymore.\n\nOn another Topic, this habit gets me in Summer break and times i should Just forget about studying and rest, do what i want. Instead i waste my time studying, waking up early and going until 8/10 pm studying to get college things done earlier . The result is that i wasted multiple breaks i wish i was with my parents, but instead i Sat down in the computer and read about some college subject all day.\n\nOne may think this is a wonderful habit, dilligent and whatever but no, this is horrible, the Second one specifically is making me Miserable, because i cant quit as i feel bad by not studying in break per\u00edods, and because i dont do anything Fun either. \n\nSoo, what can i do? How can i quit the habit in such break times and reforma It in college semesters to something that doesnt devour all my free time? I'm afraid its been taking a bad mental toll on me, as i havent drawn or some stuff i find Fun for almost year, hell i didnt even rest on my birthday due to It.\n\n  \n",

I\u2019m 25F, as I\u2019ve aged I\u2019ve become more and more inconsistent with things in my life I.e. money, jobs, hobbies, my social life, etc. when I was a teenager and had my first job, I worked it for 2 years easily. I did get into drugs when I was 16-21. 16 I was smoking weed, then 17-18 I started abusing Xanax and other benzos. By 19, I was abusing MDMA, Xanax, Coke, whippets, Percocet and more (never went as far as smoking meth or shooting up.) I got clean when I was almost 22. I met my current boyfriend at 21. He\u2019s amazing, supportive, hardworking and above all he\u2019s consistent with his work and finances. I left my food service job and decided to work in an office setting. That didn\u2019t work out so I moved onto a cleaning company. That also didn\u2019t work out so. I  found myself Working from home online\u2026not the most beautiful job but it pays decent but I\u2019m so inconsistent. In December of 2024 I fell and herniated two discs in my lower back and that set me back tremendously as I had to attend intense PT for a year and physically couldn\u2019t work. It\u2019s 2026 and I\u2019m no where near capable of working an in person FT job due to physical limitations. I have a high school diploma and that\u2019s it. I have no money, no savings and I feel like I\u2019m crumbling. I want to do so much with my life but my inconsistency is overwhelming because why can\u2019t I just work normally and save my money? I\u2019m so envious of people I know in my town who are going out and doing the things they love without money being an issue. I want consistency for working and financial freedom. I don\u2019t need to make a million dollars a year to be happy. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going with this or why I\u2019m even writing this. I\u2019m just at my wits end with myself and I feel like dogshit. I never was like this growing up. I feel the drugs I did caused some damage to my young brain before it fully developed. I know it\u2019s not the end for me and I know I can do more for myself and with my life. I just need realistic goals and advice. I don\u2019t want to be disappointed in myself anymore\n\nI want more for myself and more for my boyfriend and I combined. Please if anyone has felt the same or been through similar and has successfully gotten out of it, please let me know how you did it. I can start small and work my way up. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. ",

    "selftext": "Let me just tell you exactly what happened this morning because I think the specifics matter.\n\nPlan: wake 6:40am, water, settle, open MAT 237 calculus textbook by 8am, work until noon. Four hours of deep work. Simple.\n\nReality:\n\n**night before** living with my girlfriend. Last night we were together until 11:30pm, which means I was almost certainly not asleep until midnight.\n\n**6:40am** \u2014 Wake up automatically. Immediately thirsty, need to pee, feel absolutely destroyed. I stayed up with my girlfriend until 11:30 last night so I'm running on maybe 6.5 hours of sleep. The inertia is physical \u2014 like my body weighs twice as much as usual. My first instinct is to go back to sleep. Instead I use what I think of as \"opposite action\" \u2014 don't think about how bad you feel, just do the next step. I get up. I drink a big glass of water.\n\n**~7:00am** \u2014 Still feel like garbage. I negotiate with myself: okay, not 8am, I'll start at 9am instead. I open my laptop to pull up my calculus textbook. But there's something nagging at me \u2014 I emailed my professor about a missed term test and I don't know if he's replied yet. I sit there for a few minutes genuinely battling whether to check. I don't check. Instead \u2014 and I genuinely cannot fully explain how this happened \u2014 I open a website I'd been reading the night before. It's one of those sites with sarcastic 4chan commentary and I thought it was hilarious. I read it for **thirty minutes** and I'm laughing the whole time. Not scrolling mindlessly \u2014 actually laughing. Which almost makes it worse.\n\n**~7:35am** \u2014 I close the tab, feel disgusted with myself, and decide what I need is a Monster energy drink. I had explicitly, out-loud promised myself I was done with energy drinks. I go to the convenience store downstairs. I buy a Monster. I also buy four protein bars \u2014 I'm doing intermittent fasting, first meal at noon, but I figure one protein bar now is fine. I eat two of them on the walk home (maybe 90 seconds). I put the other two in the freezer, telling myself I'm done.\n\n**8:57am** \u2014 I'm back at my desk. My girlfriend, who's been asleep until now, wakes up and calls for me from her bedroom. I think \"...honestly why not\" and go. I come back at **9:20am**.\n\n**9:20am** \u2014 I immediately eat the other two protein bars from the freezer. No explanation. The fasting is just gone now. I try to start working. It's happening but I'm at like 30% \u2014 slow, foggy, effortful.\n\n**10:30am** \u2014 Girlfriend appears at my door. We spend the rest of the morning together until 11:30am.\n\n**11:30am** \u2014 I sit down. My deep work block produced roughly **40 minutes of mediocre work**.\n\nThe thing that kills me is I *watched* it happen. At every single decision point I knew what I was doing. The 4chan thing \u2014 I knew. The energy drink \u2014 I knew. The protein bars \u2014 I knew. And I did them anyway.\n\nI've read Atomic Habits, Deep Work, GTD. I'm not missing information. My environment is just completely misaligned with my intentions: girlfriend in the next room, phone accessible, convenience store one floor down, no external structure forcing me anywhere.\n\nI'm thinking about shifting the block to **12\u20134pm** since by noon I've naturally recovered, eaten, and cleared the morning chaos. But I'm genuinely not sure if that's a real fix or just procrastination with extra steps.\n\nHas anyone actually solved this? Not theoretically \u2014 actually solved it, in a messy real-life environment?\n\n---\n\n*Not looking for \"just have more discipline\" \u2014 I'm asking what the actual structural intervention was that changed things for you.*",

    "selftext": "I'm back in school full-time after taking a year off. I was doing well during the first few weeks of the semester, but I'm feeling rundown and like there aren't enough hours in the day to get everything done. However, I think it's largely self-inflicted.\n\nHere's a vague overview of my schedule:\n\n\\- I have most of my classes in the morning. Some days they run until 11am and on others   there's a \\~1.5 hour block in between two classes, and the latter ends \\~1 pm.\n\n\\- After classes, I have to catch the bus from campus to work. Depending on which bus is running on time and how much time I have for the commute, it might take me 40-60 minutes to get there.\n\n\\- I work for 3-3.5 hrs in the afternoon, and typically get off around 6pm. I usually get a ride home from one of my parents when I get off, but there are days I have to go back to campus for study groups, appointments at our writing center, etc. For example, there's one day a week where I attend a study group for Orgo 2 that runs from 8-10 pm. I catch the bus back to campus on those days.\n\n\\- On the days I can go straight home, I get back around 6:30-7 pm. The rest of the evening goes to chores, homework/studying, and my nighttime routine (I have a whole dental hygiene routine per my dentist). \n\nThe problem areas:\n\n\\- I'm super sleepy at the end of the day, and I end up crashing around midnight. That's not necessarily bad because it means I'm typically not staying up until the early hours of the morning, but I never get as much done as I intend to.\n\n\\- I have a problem being productive on the weekends. I'll set goals and everything, but I'll end up sleeping for obnoxious amounts of time and it throws my whole day off. Example: This past weekend I fell alseep at midnight on Friday evening and woke up around 11am on Saturday. I was terrible about getting out of bed so I didn't get any work done in the morning like I wanted to. I also didn't leave the house to head to campus until the very last minute. I ended up being only a few minutes late to the meeting I had to attend on campus, but by then I'd wasted half the day. I grabbed lunch, came home, and fell asleep again. I slept through most of the evening and I was somehow still tired after that.\n\n\\- Virtually nothing got done this past Saturday even though I had an essay to write. I did the bare minimum outlining and organizing my sources, but I didn't start writing the actual essay until Sunday. \n\n\\- On Sunday, I actually did make it out of the house and to campus by an okay-ish time, but didn't start writing my paper until 3pm. I use an app called TrackIt for its pomodoro timer and it logs the time I spend studying or working on assignments (I'm good about not checking emails/texts during these focus sessions so I trust the numbers). Long story short, the essay isn't done and I'm wishing I didn't have to work this afternoon so I can finish it, but I have to go in.\n\nI genuinely don't know what's wrong with me. I knew this assignment was coming, did the readings, met with my TA and a grad student at our writing center to discuss the topic and help develop my thesis, but I still dropped the ball. I didn't have an actual thesis that I felt addressed the prompt sufficiently until last night. It was like I had an \"a-ha! moment\" after a week of struggling to come up with a thesis, but it came way too late.\n\nThe frustrating part is that I wasn't goofing off instead of writing my paper. I had two exams last week and put a lot of time into preparing for both. That time paid off for at least one of the exams because I earned an A. Still waiting for scores for the second exam to come out. And the week before that I earned a B on my Orgo exam.\n\nI'm just so disappointed in myself. Because I still need to finish the essay, I'm now losing time to do the readings, practice problems, and what have you for my other classes. How do you all get around the tendency to procrastinate on the weekends? Is there a better way I can structure my time outside of classes and work? Sorry for this post essentially being me whining about the consequences of my actions, but any guidance or even tough love is appreciated.",

Rather, i want to do things but i cant get myself to do them. Its like i need someone to yell at me, shame, or apply some type of emotional stress as a threat for me to do simple stuff like getting out of bed. It\u2019s as bad as if i hear footsteps outside of my door in the morning that that will actually get me out of bed or atleast more likely to do so because of the internalized fear or something whatever it is from my parents unceasing need to get me out of bed every morning without ever really letting me come to a reason to do it for myself. Sort of like when your parents do everything for you, you never learn to do it for yourself. Or at-least the why behind it. They never explained anything, just gave orders and backed it up with some negative emotional stimulus every-time.\n\nOf course you could say now well I can think for myself and da da da da da but of course I can but nothing is really working. I only get out of bed to go to work to escape living at home, but now that I\u2019m on vacation I noticed I rather stay in bed everyday, or if my parents want me to go somewhere with them I rather just stay home and they cant yell at me more because Im an adult. The issue is its like theres a reality where I do want to get out of bed to do things i like, or go places with them based from my own decision, but it\u2019s so hard to follow through on that.\n\nDoing nothing is so much easier and I dont have the habits in me to do things for positive reasons. I try to come up with so many reasons from the common sense to the extreme to be active, but the only things that seem to work are punishment based from outside stresses of which i have very few.\n\nIm at a loss for what to do. Ill spend the whole day doing nothing then spend the last few moments of it taking care of what absolutely needs to get done\u2014 and sometimes ill even put that off to tomorrow.\n\nIts honestly despicable and i want to taje accountability but I see no truth in any of this being my fault. Only bad parenting to turn me into a shit heel. Forgive my language.\n\nIm trying to reprogram myself to be free and full of vitality but nothing really works. When work starts back up again, ill probably be much more active because the negative feeling of feeling like i dont have time for myself or anything i like doing will kick in, and then I\u2019ll actually be more willing to do stuff. But i hate living like that and when i get one break i become this unfulfilled self that cant do anything for himself.\n\nPlease help with how i can successfully reprogram everything about me.",

    "selftext": "About 6 weeks ago I got tired of vague advice about \"reducing screen time\" so I decided to actually track the data myself. Every time I noticed I'd lost focus or picked up my phone when I wasn't planning to, I'd log it: time of day, what I was doing before, how long the distraction lasted, and what triggered it.\n\n\n\nAfter 30 days I had about 340 logged incidents. Here's what actually surprised me:\n\n\n\n1. 73% happened in just 3 time windows. The first 20 minutes after waking up. The first 30 minutes after lunch. The hour right after I closed my laptop for the day. Outside those windows I was actually pretty fine. I'd been treating it like an all-day problem when it was really a transition problem.\n\n\n\n2. The trigger was almost never boredom. I expected boredom to be the main driver but it was only about 12% of incidents. The biggest driver was task friction: I'd hit a slightly hard part of something, and before I consciously decided anything I was already on my phone. Not to escape, just to avoid the micro-discomfort of the next step.\n\n\n\n3. Social notifications were a much smaller problem than I expected. Only 8% of my incidents were triggered by a notification. Most happened with my phone on silent, face down. The habit ran without any external trigger.\n\n\n\nWhat this changed for me: I stopped trying to have discipline all day and started protecting just those 3 windows specifically. No phone for the first 20 minutes of the morning. A short physical break after lunch before starting anything new. A clear \"end of work\" ritual before allowing myself to scroll.\n\n\n\nMy unfocused incidents dropped by about 60% in the following 3 weeks and I barely had to white-knuckle anything because I was only fighting it at three specific times instead of all day.\n\n\n\nThe meta lesson: most of us are trying to solve a precision problem with a blunt tool. You don't need discipline for 16 hours a day. You need it for maybe 90 minutes, in the right 90 minutes.\n\n\n\nCurious if anyone else has tracked this kind of thing. What were your unexpected patterns?",

Then I'd have days where I accomplished nothing and have no idea why either. Everything felt inconsistent and random.\n\n\n\nSo I tried something different. For one week, every time I lost focus or switched tasks without finishing something, I logged it. Just a note on my phone. What I was doing, what pulled me away, what time it was.\n\n\n\nAfter 7 days I had 200+ interruptions logged. The pattern was humiliating.\n\n\n\n94% of them were self-initiated. Not someone else interrupting me. Me interrupting myself.\n\n\n\nThe breakdown:\n\n\n\n\\- 41% was reaching for my phone to \"quickly check\" something before I'd even started the hard task\n\n\\- 28% was switching to an easier task when I hit the first moment of friction in a harder one\n\n\\- 17% was getting up to do something physical (water, snacks, bathroom) specifically at the moment I was about to do something I didn't want to do\n\n\\- 14% was everything else\n\n\n\nThat third category was the one that actually surprised me. I wasn't even aware I was doing it. My body was physically removing itself from the situation to delay starting. Classic avoidance wearing a productivity costume.\n\n\n\nWhat changed after seeing this:\n\n\n\nI stopped treating focus as a willpower problem and started treating it as a timing and trigger problem. The phone going to the other room wasn't about discipline, it was about removing the trigger that caused 41% of my interruptions.\n\n\n\nI started noticing when I was about to self-interrupt and would just name it out loud (or in my head). \"I'm avoiding this.\" That second of awareness is usually enough to not act on it.\n\n\n\nI set a rule: no task switching for the first 25 minutes of anything. If I hit friction, I log it and push through instead of pivoting.\n\n\n\nThree months in, my productive output has basically doubled. Not because I became a different person with more willpower. But because I finally understood where my time was actually going.\n\n\n\nIf you feel stuck or inconsistent, try logging your interruptions for just 3 days before changing anything. You can't fix what you can't see. The data will tell you exactly what's sabotaging you better than any productivity system will.",

    "selftext": "How many times have you felt inadequate because society \u2014 and especially social media \u2014 tells you that you must be special?\n\nYou must be unique.\n\nYou must stand out.\n\nYou must shine like a star.\n\nWe are constantly told that if we don\u2019t do something extraordinary, our life has no value. That if we are not exceptional, we are invisible.\n\nBut have you ever stopped to ask yourself\u2026\n\nWhat does \u201cspecial\u201d actually mean?\n\nOriginally, the word \u201cspecial\u201d comes from the idea of belonging to a species.\n\nIt didn\u2019t mean superstar.\n\nIt didn\u2019t mean exceptional.\n\nIt didn\u2019t mean superior.\n\nIt simply meant: part of a species.\n\nWe are human beings. We belong to the human species. And yet, somewhere along the way, we were programmed to believe that being human is not enough.\n\nWe were taught that we must be different, extraordinary, better than others. Life becomes a competition. A constant comparison.\n\nAnd this pressure slowly destroys our self-esteem.\n\nBecause if everyone has to be special\u2026 then no one truly is.\n\nThe obsession with being exceptional makes ordinary life feel like failure. But ordinary life is not a failure. It is reality.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be sensational.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be a character.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to live an extreme, dramatic, cinematic life.\n\nYou need to be human.\n\nAnd there is immense beauty in that simplicity.\n\nTo understand this pressure more clearly, we need to talk about two lenses through which we interpret reality:\n\nThe subjective lens.\n\nAnd the objective lens.\n\nThe subjective is what we feel. What we experience. What we believe. It is personal, emotional, and internal.\n\nThe objective is what exists independently of our feelings. It is measurable, observable, and external.\n\nToday, there are two extremes.\n\nSome people say: \u201cEverything is subjective.\u201d\n\nOthers say: \u201cEverything is objective.\u201d\n\nBut the truth often lies in between.\n\nOur experiences are subjective.\n\nBut reality is not entirely shaped by our emotions.\n\nConfusing these two lenses creates chaos. When we treat feelings as facts, or deny feelings completely, we lose balance.\n\nLearning to distinguish between subjective and objective reality is one of the most powerful tools for mental clarity and personal freedom.\n\nOne of the most profound human questions is the existence of God.\n\nFrom an objective, scientific perspective, there is no empirical proof of God\u2019s existence.\n\nYet subjectively, for billions of people, God feels absolutely real.\n\nThis shows something important:\n\nAn idea can be subjectively powerful without being objectively verified.\n\nGod can function psychologically. It can provide comfort, meaning, and structure. In that sense, it can be understood as a functional mental construct \u2014 something that exists within human consciousness.\n\nThe same applies to the afterlife.\n\nAt the moment of death, some neuroscientific theories suggest the brain may experience altered perceptions of time. A brief neurological process could subjectively feel like eternity.\n\nFrom the inside, it may feel infinite.\n\nFrom the outside, it may be seconds.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean people are foolish. It means the human mind is incredibly powerful.\n\nUnderstanding this difference doesn\u2019t destroy meaning. It refines it.\n\nSo what do we do with all of this?\n\nFirst, we release ourselves from the obsession with being special.\n\nSecond, we learn to separate what we feel from what objectively is.\n\nThird, we question our beliefs.\n\nNot to become cynical.\n\nNot to become empty.\n\nBut to become conscious.\n\nCritical thinking is not about rejecting everything. It\u2019s about examining everything.\n\nWhen you question your beliefs, you don\u2019t weaken yourself \u2014 you strengthen your mind.\n\nAnd once you free yourself from the pressure to be extraordinary, something unexpected happens:\n\nYou start giving your best \u2014 not to impress the world, but to honor your own humanity.\n\nBeing normal is not being mediocre.\n\nBeing human means thinking, feeling, doubting, growing.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be a star.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be exceptional.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to win the competition of existence.\n\nYou just need to live honestly, consciously, and fully.\n\nStop trying to be special.\n\nStart being human.\n\nAnd that \u2014 quietly, deeply \u2014 is extraordinary.",

    "selftext": "I am 20, introverted, and for the past few days I have been having more social interactions than usual. I talked to my brother who's a few years older than me, caught up with a friend who's also older, and had a few other conversations that got me thinking more than I expected and what I kept noticing was the way these people think. The groundedness they carry,the confidence in how they see the world and their place in it. There's something solid about their mentality like they have an anchor. A solid core, strong mentality. Something they operate from.\n\nAnd when I thought about myself,I realized I don't really have that yet.\n\nI wouldn't call my mindset immature exactly. It's not like I am naive or completely clueless about life. But it feels very unformed. Like I can see what a strong, mature mentality looks like but I haven't built one yet. No strong foundation,no anchor to hold onto when things get uncertain.\n\nThe frustrating part is I can clearly see and feel the gap. I know what I am missing but knowing it and actually building it feel like two completely different things and I have no idea how to get from one to the other. Is it just time? Is it experience? Is it the kind of situations you put yourself through? I genuinely don't know.\nI also don't know if this self awareness is even good for me. On one hand it feels like the first step toward something. On the other hand it's been bugging me for days and sometimes it just feels like I am standing at the bottom of a mountain with no idea where to start climbing.\n\nI know people change and grow with time, and I know mindset isn't built overnight. But I guess I am looking for some perspective from people who've been here before.\n\nFor those of you who felt this way around my age, did it eventually click? Was there something specific that helped you build that mental foundation, or was it mostly just living through things? Did the self awareness help or did it just make you spiral for a while before it became useful?\n\nWould really appreciate hearing from people who've actually been through this.",

Once I opened social media, my discipline was shot for the next hour.\n\nI realized that for my brain, \"willpower\" wasn't enough to stop the craving for a dopamine hit. I needed to satisfy that craving without leaving my workspace.\n\nI\u2019ve been testing a method where I use a Passive Visual Anchor directly on my Windows taskbar. It\u2019s essentially a tiny, non-intrusive \"living\" environment (a small pet and garden) that just exists at the bottom of my screen.\n\nThe logic:\n\nWhenever I feel that \"itch\" to switch tabs or check my phone, I give myself 10 seconds to look at the taskbar companion. Because I\u2019m not changing my physical environment (leaving the PC) or context-switching (opening a browser), I find it 10x easier to slide back into my work.\n\nIt also has a simple built-in Pomodoro and a spot for a single sticky note, which keeps my \"minimalist setup\" intact.\n\nSince I started doing this, my \"phone-reaching\" habit has dropped significantly because my brain gets its tiny \"reset\" without actually exiting the flow state.\n\nHas anyone else tried using passive visual tools to anchor their focus? I\u2019m curious if anyone has found other \"desktop-native\" ways to satisfy the urge for a break without losing momentum.",

Always arguing with mom and dad, my family for the past few years been suffering quite a lot from multiple things especially mom and dad, and with me a cherry on top i just make everything worse. the reason why I am still here is because of my pure faith/trust in my God (ALLAH SWT). idk how much depression affected me, because I never told a single soul about it to anyone. did a little bit of research and found out that not talking about your feelings can greatly affect you especially mentally. i dont want to seem like an attention seeker/add more problems in my family. the reason why i am posting here is because i can stay anonymous and finally speak about my life/what i have been struggling with.\n\nI have struggled a lot in school not just academically but socially, i just kinda never fit in, but Alhamdullilah at least I have 1 true friend, I struggle a lot with few addictions that i have for a few years and i have been trying to quit this addiction for like 2 to 3 years and yet still failing while others seem to quit it much faster. sometimes i feel like i deserve all the bad things that happened to me which is most likely true but not 100% sure. i am very big failure to my Lord and the same time i have made it this far and still pushing because of him, because of the hope and trust i still have in him.\n\nsometimes i wish that i was a better son or i was replaced with a great son, sitting alone in my room in the middle of the night just thinking about my life wishing i had a better life or someone deserving it more than me be at my place. my depression affected a lot I think, my mood is very bad and severe brain fog. people alway say \"think positive\" i do and i try my best but still ending up failing and yes failing is part of life but for me it keeps getting worse the loop and constant disappointment i am to my family continues, I will keep fighting it (depression) but sometimes i just think that depression is a part of me, i cant get rid of something that is a part of me and maybe thinking that instead of fighting it I should just accept it and live with it till the end but for now i will keep fighting. to make everything confusing (non-intentional) whenever my depressive episodes get worse, I find so much comfort in it and especially a sense of belonging, than being happy there were times where i was temporarily happy but that depressive feeling was lingering and eventually came back to me.\n\nsome other things that i experience i dont even know how to describe, its like everyone suffers but they get back up stronger and beat their difficulties but me no matter how much i try i keep failing and ending up more miserable. i have always been bad at things in general that doesnt require high level skills but just general, the only thing i am actually good at in sports wise is combat sports its one of the things that actually gave me some good feeling and finally being good at something but i am afraid that because of my depression and everything else i will lose one of the only thing i love. a promise i made to myself and my lord is that i will keep fighting it and overcome my challenges, hoping it gets better for me and my family. seeing people at my work laughing and seeing genuine happy faces on them makes me feel good at least they are happy with their life but at the same time wishing i had that too. another thing that actually makes actually feel something in my life is whenever i am kind to people i will alway try to make someones life easier, make them feel happy, included at work or anywhere else. i have done some things that i regret so deeply that realised later in my life, wishing i could go back to them and Apologise. sometimes i just wanna be alone and at the same time when i am alone i feel so lonely but at the same finally in some temporary peace, I get this feelings in my head randomly that its best if i never have a wife or a family because i will make their life shit and its best if i just live alone for the rest of my life so i dont have to worry about anything other than my Lord.\n\nto all of yous struggling with this disease I will pray for you that whatever you are struggling with will get better in your life and you can achieve your goals. try your best not to let depression get to your daily things because if you let it, you will fall behind. ALL love hope it gets better for all of yous.\n\na quote i got from nate fisher from the series sixfeetunder. \"i spent my whole life being scared. scared of not being ready, of not being right, of not being who i should be and where did it get me\". thanks to anyone who read the whole thing or even a fraction of it.

Kind of a dumb loop when I step back and look at it.\n\nI\u2019ve tried the usual stuff. Strict routines, making rules for myself. Sometimes it works for a bit then I either get around it or just get tired of fighting myself all day.\n\nLately I\u2019ve been wondering if discipline isn\u2019t the real problem. Maybe I just keep expecting myself to ignore distractions that are constantly right in front of me. That\u2019s a harder battle than I like to admit.\n\nRight now I\u2019m trying smaller adjustments instead of big dramatic fixes. Making distractions slightly harder to reach, not doing the quick check before starting, stuff like that. Still messy though.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like dopamine always wins in the moment even when you genuinely want to do better?\n\n**Edit (Update):** Thankyou everyone for all the advices. A few people mentioned leaving their phone in another room or just taking short breaks in form of walking..... that actually helped more than I expected. I also tried blocking real time slots on Google Calendar to keep me on track. The one thing that really stood out was when I started using Jolt screen time. It\u2019s wild how something so simple can make you Stop and think before falling into the scroll loop. It sounds silly but that One second of guilt genuinely works, that small pop-up did what 100 Discipline HACKS couldn\u2019t.\n\n",

Half the time nobody even responded and it just got annoying for       \n\n  everyone.                                                                                                                                                             \n\n\n\n  So I ended up building something. I called it Keep Going.\n\n  Basically it's a habit tracker but built around a small group of people you actually know. No random strangers, no public leaderboards, none of that. Just you and a\n\n  few friends who can see if each other showed up today.\n\n  The way it works is pretty simple you log your habits by hitting a + button, your friends can see a live dot on your card that says Active today or not, and if\n\n  someone's been quiet you can tap their card and send them a nudge which is an actual push notification that hits their phone. They can also see your habit names and\n\n  how many days you've kept them up.\n\n  Honestly the thing that surprised me was how it stopped being about my friends after a while. Even on days nobody else logs anything I still open it and hit the +\n\n  just for the green checkmark. Like that small moment of \"I showed up today\" became the whole thing. 53 days of meditation, 50 days of supplements, 42 days at the gym, I didn't even realize those numbers were building up until I looked back.\n\n  The accountability got me started. The checkmark kept me going.\n\n  Not trying to sell anything, this is just something I use every day and it's genuinely helped me stay consistent longer than anything else I'v tried ",

    "selftext": "My entire life I have over eaten, I would always eat until my stomach was hard and full. I would eat an entire bag of chips casually when I was 8. I would eat fast food every week. I would eat my vegetables but that was also something I overate. My family would call me a \u201cgull\u201d or a \u201cblack hole\u201d with how I just never seemed to get full. I was extremely skinny as a kid so I guess it never occurred to my mother that it could be an issue. I became independently homeless at 12 and would house hop. I would eat canned food, expired food, fast food, whatever I could get my hands on.\n\nI am now 21 and, though i\u2019m not overweight, I can\u2019t stop eating and it makes me feel so angry with myself. I go through phases with overeating and then I get angry that it causes me to try to suppress my hungry. I love to cook but I also love to eat out. I will eat food off other people\u2019s plates if they are done. I hate seeing food wasted and even if I am full I will try to finish it. \n\n I just don\u2019t know what to do to stop it. It has been my entire life and it wasn\u2019t made any better with the food insecurity from being homeless. Every time I try to stop it, I fail within a week or less. I luckily don\u2019t like sugar, I will avoid any sweets the best I can so that\u2019s not a problem. \n\n I bloat, break out, and my face swells anytime I find myself overeating, with fast food especially. I love all types of food too so it\u2019s hard to not overeat literally anything. I need creative ways to stop myself, discipline by itself is proving to not be enough. I think I\u2019ve been doing better but I am still incredibly unhappy with my habits. \n\n  Any advice I will take and try my best to apply",

    "selftext": "For a long time I thought nicotine was helping me. Helping me focus. Helping me relax. Helping me deal with stress. In reality, it was just something I leaned on so I didn\u2019t have to sit with my own thoughts. It slowly became part of everything. I\u2019d reach for it when I woke up, when I was bored, when I was stressed, when I needed a break, when I wanted to reward myself. It stopped being a choice and started being automatic. That\u2019s the scary part. You don\u2019t notice when something goes from being a habit to being a dependency.\n\nWhen I finally decided to stop, I realized how much control it actually had over me. My brain would constantly try to convince me that I needed it. Not wanted it. Needed it. Just one hit. Just today. Just to take the edge off. That voice was always there, especially when things felt uncomfortable. The first few days sucked. I was irritated for no reason. I couldn\u2019t sit still. My focus was all over the place. Everything felt slightly harder than normal. Not unbearable, just annoying enough to make quitting feel pointless.\n\nBut I stuck with it, mostly out of stubbornness.\n\nAnd then something changed. I started noticing how much calmer my baseline felt. Not that fake calm you get from a hit, but a real steadiness. My anxiety dropped. My thoughts slowed down. I wasn\u2019t constantly waiting for my next fix. For the first time in a long time, I felt present.\n\nThe biggest shift wasn\u2019t physical though. It was mental.Every time I resisted a craving, I felt a small sense of control come back. Like I was rebuilding trust with myself. I started realizing that discipline isn\u2019t about motivation. It\u2019s about being able to sit with discomfort and not immediately escape it.\n\nNicotine was my escape. Stress, boredom, frustration, fatigue. I used it to avoid feeling those things fully. When I took it away, I had no choice but to face them. And that\u2019s where the real growth happened. I had to learn how to calm myself down instead of relying on something external. I had to learn how to push through low-energy days. I had to learn how to be uncomfortable without panicking.\n\nAnd slowly, that made me stronger.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to quit, just know this. The cravings pass. The discomfort fades. But the discipline you build stays. Each time you don\u2019t give in, you prove to yourself that you\u2019re capable of more than you thought. Quitting nicotine didn\u2019t just remove a bad habit. It forced me to build real discipline. And that has changed how I approach everything in my life.",

On those days I have to leave home at 7.00am and so I created a routine that works great for me:\n\nI wake up and 5.32 am, I get up at 5:35am with my second alarm, then I sort of pray for five minutes, go straight to the bathroom to wash my face and brush my teeth, then go back to my bedroom, take my iron an change to workout clothes and go downstairs to drink my morning warm water with honey and to prepare what I'll need to make breakfast. I go upstairs again and do a 10 to 15min workout. Make my bed, change clothes, do my hair and go downstairs to make breakfast. I eat it, I make my coffee to bring with me to uni, I put my shoes on and I'm out to go.\n\nI have this routine written on a paper in my desk so that I know what to do every morning and don't waste time. For me, this works great and is sustainable. I try to go to bed at 9:00/9:30pm so that I get enough sleep.\n\nHowever, when I don't have classes I cannot get up as soon as the alarm sets of, whatever the time is. I could set an alarm for 5:32am or 9:30, I could sleep for 6 or 10 hours, it makes no difference, I can't get up. I suppose the reason is that I don't need that routine for that day, or at least some parts of it, such as working out first thing in the morning (or I won't have the time or will to do it any other time in the day), or preparing my coffee, or dressing up for uni.\n\n**The problem is:** because I don't need to follow that routine, I end up not working out at all because I can do it later in the day, but I never do because I never feel like doing it. I also feel that because I don't follow a routine whatsoever, I don't do much throughout the day and if I do, it doesn't have an order, in the sense that it feels a bit chaotic like 'I'll do whatever I need to do in that moment' and studying is never a part of it.\n\nI am a good student but my grades could be better if studied with more time (I usually only study before exams), so I really want to study and workout every day. Working out comes from wanting to improve my posture, get leaner and regulate my ADHD. But I can't I get myself to do both of those things unless it's on the days I have to follow my routine.\n\nWhat do I do? Has any of you gone through this? Are there any good advice you guys could share with me?\n\nThank you in advance for the time you took to read this and help me \ud83e\ude77",

    "selftext": "Why do intelligent people keep making the same catastrophic mistakes? I think I finally understand what's actually happening.\n\n\n\nIn 1935 Australia had a beetle problem. Cane beetles were devastating sugar cane crops across Queensland and someone came up with what seemed like a reasonable solution. Cane toads had controlled beetle populations in other parts of the world. Import them, release them, let nature handle it.\n\n101 toads were brought in from Hawaii and released.\n\nNobody thought to ask whether cane toads could actually reach the beetles. Which sounds almost too obvious to say out loud in hindsight. Cane beetles live and feed underground. Cane toads hunt above ground. There's just no mechanism there. No scenario where that works. And it's not like this required specialized knowledge to figure out, it just never got asked.\n\nThe beetles kept destroying crops. The toads, with no natural predators and an entire continent of food available to them, did what living things do. They spread. They produce a toxin that kills most things that try to eat them so native predator populations collapsed wherever they moved. 90 years later the estimated population is around 200 million and still expanding. The ecological damage has no end in sight.\n\nI keep coming back to the fact that the people who made this decision weren't careless or stupid. They had a real problem, they found something that had worked somewhere else, and they applied it. Nobody stopped to verify whether the solution actually had a mechanism for addressing what the problem was made of.\n\nHere's the thing though. This isn't a historical anomaly. It seems to be the default.\n\nIn 1949 Walter Freeman won the Nobel Prize in Medicine for the lobotomy. By that point he had already performed thousands of them, sometimes 25 in a single day, occasionally using an ice pick inserted through the eye socket. The problem he was trying to solve was real, severe mental illness was devastating patients' lives and overcrowding institutions with no good treatment options. The solution seemed to work, patients became calmer and more manageable after the procedure. The mechanism question nobody asked was what mental illness is actually made of and whether severing frontal lobe connections has any mechanism for addressing that. It was never asked. What the procedure actually did was cause such severe brain damage that patients could no longer express their distress. They weren't calmer because they were better. They were calmer because significant parts of their personality and cognitive function had been destroyed. An estimated 60,000 lobotomies were performed. Many patients died. Many more were left in permanent vegetative states or with devastating personality changes. Freeman was celebrated as a pioneer the entire time.\n\nAnd then there's OxyContin.\n\nIn 1995 the FDA approved a new extended release opioid painkiller with a claim written directly into its official label: that the slow release formulation made it less prone to abuse and addiction than other opioids. This claim became the foundation of one of the most aggressive pharmaceutical marketing campaigns in history. Purdue Pharma trained thousands of sales reps to tell doctors the addiction risk was less than one percent. Prescriptions surged. What nobody had verified before writing that claim onto the label and building a billion dollar marketing campaign around it was whether slow release opioid delivery actually has a mechanism for reducing addiction. Purdue never conducted clinical trials to test this. The FDA never required them to. They accepted a plausible sounding theory without asking what opioid addiction is actually made of and whether the proposed mechanism actually addresses that. It doesn't. The addiction pathway doesn't meaningfully care about release rate. Over 800,000 people have died. The crisis is still ongoing.\n\nThree completely different domains. Three completely different centuries. The same failure every time. A real problem, a solution that seemed to address the surface symptom, and nobody asked whether the solution had an actual working mechanism for what the problem was fundamentally made of.\n\nI've been sitting with this pattern for a long time because I've lived a version of it personally.\n\nWhen I was 19 I developed intercostal neuralgia, a nerve condition affecting the nerves between your ribs. Every inhale hurt. Not discomfort. Pain. I went to the doctor wanting one thing: make it stop. Got prescribed Dilaudid. The pain became marginally more manageable and I told myself that was a solution.\n\nWhat I didn't see was that I hadn't solved anything. I'd just changed the question I was living inside. It was no longer how do I stop this pain. It was how do I maintain access to enough medication to function. A completely different problem that I hadn't chosen and didn't notice arriving.\n\nFive years passed.\n\nEventually the situation became bad enough that I finally asked a completely different question. Not how do I make this stop. What is this actually made of? What's genuinely happening and what does it actually need?\n\nI taught myself the relevant biochemistry from scratch. Spent a long time learning how nerve pain actually works at a cellular level, what inflammatory pathways are involved, what compounds interact with those pathways and how. Found things that actually addressed what the problem was made of rather than just muffling the signal that the problem existed. I've been entirely off prescription medication for years now.\n\nThe reframe took an afternoon. Five years inside the wrong question. One afternoon outside it.\n\nSo I've been trying to articulate what these situations all have in common and I think it's this:\n\nAsking the wrong question doesn't just give you the wrong answer. It traps you. You can work incredibly hard, follow every available option, do everything right within the framing you've been given, and make no real progress because the framing itself has no exit built into it. The loop can't generate a better question from inside itself. The only way out is to step outside the framing entirely and ask what the problem is actually made of before you let any existing solution anywhere near it.\n\nThe people who released the cane toads never stepped outside the framing. Freeman never stepped outside the framing. The FDA and Purdue never stepped outside the framing. I spent five years not stepping outside mine. The scale is completely different. The mechanism is identical.\n\nI've started calling this Elemental Problem Solving for lack of a better term. Before you do anything else: what is this problem actually made of and what does each component actually need? Not what solutions exist. Not what has worked somewhere else. What does this specific problem require at a fundamental level for any solution to work?\n\nLooking at history this failure mode isn't rare or exceptional. It seems like the default mode of human problem solving across centuries and domains. And I genuinely can't work out why verifying that a proposed solution has an actual mechanism for the specific problem in front of you isn't just the first thing we teach people to do.\n\nWhat am I missing? Is there something fundamental about how humans think that makes this the default rather than the exception? Because if this is as universal as it appears, it seems like one of the more important things we could be teaching.\n\nIf this resonates and you want to actually practice it with other people, let me know in the comments if thats somethind youd like to be a part of.",

The gym membership I kept paying for three months after I wanted to cancel because I was terrified of the phone call.\n\nEven just walking into my classroom when people are already there and talking. I've literally stood outside the door unable to push it open because my brain is screaming that everyone will judge me.\n\nAnd every single time I avoid something, it feels like I'm being smart.

I'm just making the fear louder.\n\nBecause here's what I didn't get: when you avoid something, your brain logs it as \"too dangerous to face.\" The prediction never gets tested. So it just gets stronger and stronger until you can't even send a six word text without spiraling.\n\nA few weeks ago I got so fed up with myself that I tried something different. Instead of trying to \"just do it\" or \"be brave\" (which never works for me), I broke the thing I was avoiding into really small steps.\n\nLike embarrassingly small.\n\nFor the classroom thing, step one was literally just \"observe how other people walk into the room.\" That's it. Just watch. Don't even go in.\n\nSo I did that. And nothing bad happened.\n\nStep two was \"walk in when people are already seated so it's less visible.\" Did that. No one cared.\n\nBy the time I got to step seven (walk in confidently when everyone's socializing), I'd already survived six steps. My brain had actual evidence that I wasn't going to die.\n\nAnd here's the weird part: most of the catastrophes I predicted didn't happen. Like at all.\n\nThe breakup conversation I was dreading? I thought there would be tears and yelling and drama. What actually happened was a sad but calm conversation. We both knew it wasn't working. It hurt but it was fine.\n\nThe text to my sibling? Still haven't sent it (I'm working through the steps) but I tested it with other things and the pattern holds. My brain is usually just making shit up.\n\nI don't know if this helps anyone else but I needed to write it down because I spent so long thinking I was just a coward or broken or something. Turns out I was just treating my predictions like facts instead of testing whether they're actually true.\n\nAnyway. If you're reading this and there's something you've been avoiding for weeks (or months or years), maybe try breaking it into stupidly small steps. Not because it makes you brave. But because it lets you collect actual evidence about whether the thing you're afraid of is real or just your brain being dramatic.\n\nBrains are weird.\n\n",

    "selftext": "For YEARS, I felt tired... unmotivated... and stuck with this eternal brain fog. I struggled to get out of bed, stay fit and felt that I was someone who didn't have much potential. I even thought that I was someone who had ADHD and tried meds, self help books, therapy but they never made a lasting difference.\n\nThat was until I listened to this episode from Huberman\u2019s podcast on dopamine. I finally understood that my habits, especially those that spiked my dopamine levels were the problem.\n\nHe explained how it gives my brain quick and easy artificial 'highs' so it had no reason to work harder for more meaningful ones. That clicked with me. And the biggest culprit was obvious.\u00a0**My phone.**\u00a0Where those hours of mindless scrolling were frying my dopamine receptors. By scrolling I was rewarding myself BEFORE doing hard things instead of after, so of course I had no motivation to do anything.\n\nSo I made it my mission to change and reduced my screen time from over 10 hours a day to just two.\n\nThe result was unbelievable. I woke up with actual energy and stopped procrastinating. My attention span went from goldfish-level to actually functional. When your brain isn't constantly seeking the next hit, it's easier to just do the thing in front of you. And for the first time, I went out of my way to study, workout and bond with family / friends.\n\nA few things that really helped me:\n\n**I stopped using my phone at the gym, on public transport, or during meals.** By sitting with boredom I trained my brain to be comfortable without constant hits of stimulation.\n\n**I set a screentime goal everyday** and tracked it with simple wall calendar. Every morning I put a big 'X' if I was under the goal. Seeing the chain of X's was so satisfying and became a visual proof of progress for me.\n\n**I made it very hard to use addicting apps.** I use an app called Breaktime App Blocker to block my TikTok and Instagram 24/7. Every time I open it, it makes me wait 30 seconds first and most times I put the phone back down. If not, it makes me set a time limit and reblocks it after to hold me accountable. Theres a lot out there so find one that works for you.\n\n**Kept my mornings phone free.** I put my phone in a room, drawer or I literally put it in a tissue box and throw it across the room before bed. This was so important to stop me from burning all my motivation for the day.\n\n**I used other feel good activities as a replacement:** a walk, gyming, cooking, reading, sport, meeting friends and surprisingly chewing gum. When I get that craving to scroll, I pick one of these things and it gives me the same 'happy' feeling that scrolling would've and makes me forget about it.\n\nIt's not an easy journey but I wanted to share some tips and just how big of an impact its had. If there's something that worked for you please share below!",

    "selftext": "TLDR-(After some months of meditation, I\u2019ve learned to take responsibility for how I respond instead of blaming situations or people. Creating a pause between thoughts and reactions reduced frustration, improved how I handle teaching and studying, and even reflected in better exam results.)\n\nOne of the beautiful things about meditation is that it helps you realize things in a better way. Things that you might already know. When you see them again or read them again with a clear mind, it just hits different and settles deep within you.\n\nOne of those things I learned is about responsibility. I once read a line by Sadhguru: \u201cResponsibility means being able to respond to the best of your ability to whatever situation you may face in your life.\u201d If you understand that you are responsible for everything, then you can become how you want to be.\n\nAt first, I didn\u2019t understand what this meant. I simply forgot about it. But in the last eight months of meditation, I have had many beautiful realizations.\n\nWhile teaching my students and managing my own studies, I was getting frustrated handling everything. Before meditation, this frustration cycle might have gone on for months. But after meditation, I created some distance from my thoughts. That gave me a pause to realize that these are just tricks my brain is playing. These are things I can consciously ignore if I want.\n\nIf my students are not taking their studies seriously, troubling me, or behaving rudely, I don\u2019t need to be frustrated. I simply need to do whatever is necessary. The same with my studies. I was taking everything as a burden. Teaching students and then making time to study for myself felt hectic. But in reality, I had time to do everything.\n\nI realized that instead of treating it as a burden, if I simply do what is needed, everything happens smoothly. I just needed acceptance and understanding that my responsibility is limitless. This doesn\u2019t mean I have to control everything. It means that whatever is happening, it is my responsibility to respond to it properly.\n\nI cannot blame situations or others. If I keep doing that, I will only fill myself with resentment. But if I take responsibility for every action and every situation, then I become the one who fixes it. The solutions are not far away. It is just a matter of time, and things begin to move smoothly.\n\nI also recently scored very good marks in an exam I attended. It feels beautiful to handle everything with clarity. I am truly glad that I started meditating.\n\nThank you for reading.",

    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been at home for the past few months, I feel like I completely lost my focus and passion for studying. I really want to study and improve myself so I can get a job, but when I sit down to study something, I can\u2019t concentrate. I feel very bad. I can't express what I feel.\n\nI also feel alone recently that I want to cry. I talk to my parents, and they\u2019re friendly and supportive, but there\u2019s only certain things to share with them. Some things are to be shared with friends only.\n\nAnother thing that affects me is that I don\u2019t know how to ride a bike. It sounds easy, but it became a barrier when it came to going out with friends. I had to rely on others for rides, which made me feel dependent. I\u2019m learning now, but after just being at home, I think I'm losing my friends too. Like I don't know who should I see as my close friend.\n\nOne more thing is that I got rejected. The relationship was mutual like 2 years back. We became friends and all, because she wanted to be friends with me. She sees me as a very good friend but I consider her more than my friend. I asked her out one last time even though I know I'll get rejected but this time it felt so bad. She said don't depend on me. Life needs to go on. I blame myself because I was too afraid to talk to her properly in person. I mostly texted or called her. I keep thinking that if I had been more confident and talked to her more in person, maybe things would have been different.\n\nAnd my sleep cycle, it's more than questionable.\n\nRight now I'm stuck with everything and seriously confused which part of me to fix first. Some advice is definitely needed. Thank you in advance!",

    "selftext": "I would not have the confidence and fluidity that I have now if I had not found Taoism. While at first it didn't clearly make sense to me. Taoism finally explained to me the way energy around me and the world as a whole works with no pretense or manufactured ideology. The idea of Taoism speaks on the energy of life and the world around you as well as the friction that forcing things creates ( more to it of course but the easiest to get across ). When I started to understand the teaching of Wu-wei and how life is a-lot easier when you understand the flow of the systems you are in and what you can and cannot control thing's started to just make more sense and become easier.\n\nTheir is a-lot to how Wu-Wei applies in life and Alan Watts is a great starting place for this but overall I have to credit Taoism with the ability to have finally found what makes me hit my stride effortlessly and be able to glide through the day. It's not the solution to every problem in life but it made every problem in life have a solution in one way or another. Their is a sort of dry confidence that has washed over me in a way that to other people has even been mentioned that I seem rather weightless and fluid in my day to day activities. It has been the framework I needed since I was born but never truly understood was anything more than just what I thought was my own unique viewpoint. I might not be doing too much in my life right now but I know dam well their isn't much if anything that I can't either accomplish or overcome in one way or another.",

    "selftext": "Hello guys, I need some advice here.\n\nI'm 30M from Europe. My problem is that whenever I want to build a new habit, I always get stuck at the 'no zero days' phase. For instance, If I want to build the habit of daily meditation,I'll tell myself that even meditating for 3 minutes is better than 0 minutes, and that the focus in the beginning should be in building the habit, not on the intensity. Which is kind of true, if you think about it.\n\nWhat usually happens is that I will get a nice streak going, but the habit always remains at this superficial, 1-5 minutes range. I can't seem to graduate from doing easy 2 minute habits into working on something for a significant period of time, which at the end of the day is the only way to really get somewhere with any project.\n\nDoes anyone else relate to this issue? Do you have any ideas on how I could potentially overcome it? Thanks in advance.",

I even went on a nice long vacation after leaving the job and then things went weird.

During that time i even took up a short course and gave the certification exam after procrastinating for months. Then a few months later my long term relationship ended and after that i still have not decided what i wanna do with life. Its been a year of me being jobless and i still feel stuck. My friends can help only so much and even though my father insisted i continue the previous certification, i am also procrastinating that as well. In the past year i feel i have just wasted my time and done nothing. My savings are also run out and the only reason I am surviving is because i had taken a short term job for 2 months and gotten paid for that, and I am still living with my parents even though i wanted to move out but n ow i cant. I have no one to turn to and no idea what steps to take to get my shit together. I still dont know where to apply for jobs, what interests me and how to go about finding that as well.

Most fitness apps in this space either need a subscription to do anything useful, require sign-in just to get started, or send your workout data to a server. This one does none of that.\n\nPoint your camera, pick an exercise and it starts counting. Supports push-ups, squats, lunges, bicep curls, lateral raises, front raises, overhead press and jumping jacks. After each session you get a form score, a grade (A/B/C) and a breakdown of reps with good form so you actually know how well you moved, not just how many times you moved. Voice feedback calls out your rep count and milestones while you train so you never have to look at the screen.\n\nFree home screen widgets show your streak, total reps and progress at a glance, no sign-in required.\n\nWould love honest feedback from people who actually train or just getting started.

    "selftext": "We often think that multitasking increases our productivity.\n\nBut when it comes to two demanding cognitive tasks, the brain doesn\u2019t actually perform them simultaneously - it switches between them rapidly.\n\nAnd that switching comes at a cost.\n\nResearch on task switching shows that performance can drop significantly - in some cases by as much as \\~40%, depending on task complexity. It also increases error rates and mental fatigue.\n\nThere\u2019s also a well-known study suggesting that heavy multitasking can temporarily reduce cognitive performance in a way comparable to losing around 10 IQ points.\n\nWhy? Because switching between demanding tasks requires executive control, inhibition, and working memory - all of which consume mental energy.\n\nMultitasking is really only possible when one of the tasks is automated.\n\nFor example:\n\n\\- chewing gum while reading  \n\n\\- listening to music while running  \n\n\\- walking while talking  \n\n\n\nThese activities don\u2019t strongly compete for the same cognitive resources.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve been experimenting with simple attention and inhibitory-control tasks to observe this effect. Even short tests show a noticeable drop in consistency when trying to \"multitask\".\n\n\n\nA simple example is a classic Stroop-style task - one of the most widely used attention and inhibitory control tests:\n\n[https://globalmindtests.com/Stroop.html](https://globalmindtests.com/Stroop.html)\n\n\n\nYou respond to the word\u2019s meaning while ignoring the conflicting color. This shows how interference and inhibition affect performance - similar mechanisms are involved in task switching.\n\n\n\nDo you think doing multiple demanding tasks at once actually improves performance - or not?",

After some experimentation, the goals I ended up choosing were:\n\n* Work for at least 6 hours\n* Go for a 4 km walk\n* Finish all of my tasks in Apple Reminders\n* Weigh myself every morning\n\nThe program I built automatically tracks all of these things for me so I can't cheat. It reads health data from my apple watch and is set up so that I can't modify time on timers, only start and stop them.\n\nSo far the results have been life changing.\n\nOn the productivity front I used to struggle to get things done throughout the day. I'd do maybe 15 minutes of work and then goof off on youtube for 30 minutes. Now that I've removed all of my distractions for the first 6 hours of the day, I have no choice but to buckle in and get work done. I'm not procrastinating through the morning anymore, I just sit down and start being productive.\n\nI also used to just ignore my tasks in apple reminders. If I had something that was due, I'd just defer it til the next day or ignore it. Now I am consistently finishing my tasks on time every day. No more forgetting to pay the power bill :D\n\nOn the health side I've had some positive and negative results. My weekly step average has gone up from 1500 steps per day to 4000 steps per day and I can feel it. I used to huff and puff every time I had to walk up a hill, but now I can walk just about anywhere without feeling it. I still haven't managed to lose weight, I think that there are still some diet things that I need to work out, but overall I feel way better.\n\nThis experience has also taught me a few things:\n\n* Starting slow is better. When I first started this I set my goals way too ambitiously and ended up disabling the program for a few months before I finally sat down and re-jiggered it.\n* The system has to be flexible. One issue I've had in the past has been that I'll start a healthy habit and then get sick and abandon it. This time around I built a system into my program that lets me slowly accumulate \"passes\" over time which I can use to skip a goal if I'm not feeling it.\n* Streaks are shockingly effective. About halfway through I started counting how many days in a row I hit my goals, and that alone has almost been as motivational as being rewarded with unblocking the apps I'm addicted too.\n\nI've tried a lot of different productivity systems over the years and have never managed to maintain anything for more than a month. So far this is feeling very promising!\n\nAnyway, would love to hear if other people have experimented with similar methodology.",

    "selftext": "I finally overcame a 12 year addiction with this simple piece of knowledge:\n\n**Every single intense craving or urge you feel to do something that you don't want to do is a dopamine spike of craving, not pleasure.**\n\n**Your brain is making a prediction for what should happen, and \"uploading\" its best guess of how you should behave and feel in order to make that prediction come true.**\n\n**And that dopamine spike puts your brain in a heightened state of plasticity for about 60 seconds.**\n\nThis means you've got about one minute to take advantage of this and rewire your brain. (And the bigger the urge, the more plastic the craving area of your brain is.)\n\nIf you follow the craving, you strengthen the urge for next time.\n\nBut if you can take a step back, recognise the urge for what it is (your brain making its best guess), you can take a different action and create a new competing wiring.\n\nSome tips to help the new wiring stick faster: say something, do something, give yourself something. (That way you're activating all three dopamine pathways in your brain at once.)\n\nWhenever I was hit with an intense craving, I would say to myself \"Yes! Another chance to rewire my brain!\" and then I would do a simple stretch, and then note down the urge (and what triggered the dopamine spike) in my phone as a kind of \"reward tally.\"\n\nAnyway, just putting this out there in case it helps someone else like it helped me.\n\n(P.S. I-can't-believe-we're-at-this-point disclaimer: I did not use AI to write this post. Every word was typed by my human fingers on my Mac laptop keyboard in bed just now, next to my sleeping daughter)\n\n(P.P.S I also wrote an article on Substack explaining this and my story a little more for those who are curious. Not trying to self-promote. It's free and will always stay free. Just sharing what has helped me in case it helps others. Will happily message the link or (I hope) you can find it in my profile.)\n\nBest of luck!\n\n\\---\n\nFor those who want to know the deep neuroscience behind this, I've (hopefully) got you covered:\n\nA dopamine spike is super quick (in the range of 100-500 milliseconds), and usually decays in a few seconds. But downstream chemical effects can last for tens of seconds, creating a broader \u201celigibility window\u201d for synaptic plasticity and cue-reward tagging. While the exact window varies by circuit, dopamine-gated plasticity operates on behavioural timescales beyond the millisecond spike itself \u2014 typically seconds to tens of seconds, and in some paradigms up to \\~1 minute. Basically, what you do in the immediate aftermath of a cue is more likely to shape that pathway than behaviour occurring much later. (Note that the synaptic strengthening is circuit-specific, not global.)\n\nReferences to back this up:  \nYagishita, S. et al.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone. I recently came across this server and saw some posts about this topic, so I figured I\u2019d share my situation. I\u2019m 25 years old, a part-time student pursuing an Associate of Science degree, and I hope to build a career in the pharmacy field. I also work as a pharmacy technician at a very busy CVS. Since the start of 2026, I\u2019ve been trying to seriously focus on improving my life\u2014building social connections, getting a few Muay Thai fights under my name, finishing school, and eventually finding a better job.\n\nBefore this year, I honestly feel like I wasted a lot of time\u2014especially my childhood and teenage years. I had very bad eczema growing up, and because of it, I became extremely withdrawn socially. I avoided people and often stayed in certain areas where I felt more comfortable. My parents tried encouraging me to get involved in sports or after-school activities so I could \u201clook normal,\u201d but nothing ever stuck.\n\nInstead, I isolated myself indoors and used computer games as my main coping mechanism. Most of my free time was spent online, talking to random people in gaming chat rooms. Looking back, I feel like I missed out on a lot\u2014making meaningful memories, building confidence, or even dating. I hate admitting this, but my self-esteem was so low that I neglected my personal hygiene for a long time. My oral health suffered because of it, and now, as an adult, I\u2019m almost obsessive about taking care of my teeth and gums.\n\nEven now, I struggle to see myself as attractive, despite the compliments I sometimes receive. The impact my skin condition and years of isolation had on my confidence still sticks with me.\n\nHigh school wasn\u2019t much different. I had a few friends, but overall, most people barely knew me. I didn\u2019t even go to prom because my eczema flared up and caused complications. When I think back on those years, I sometimes feel angry with myself for how much time I spent isolating rather than trying to change things. It feels like I surrendered too easily.\n\nAfter graduation, I was basically an 18-year-old with no direction. My parents pushed me hard to attend community college, so I enrolled in a graphic design program even though I didn\u2019t really want to. Eventually, depression caught up with me. I lost track of my classes, my GPA dropped badly, and I ended up on academic probation.\n\nDuring that period, I started focusing more on work and began looking for hobbies outside the house. In 2021, while working at a clothing store, I became interested in Muay Thai. Growing up, I had been bullied for not knowing how to fight and for being underweight, so the idea was intimidating. But at the same time, I wanted to change and become stronger.\n\nI joined a Muay Thai gym at 21, and I haven\u2019t stopped since. It turned out to be one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made.\n\nIn 2025, while working, I met a pharmacy technician at CVS who encouraged me to consider a career in the pharmaceutical field. That\u2019s when I decided to change direction academically and pursue an Associate of Science degree instead. I managed to get off academic probation and get myself back on track in school. My goal now is to finally finish this chapter of my life this year.\n\nThrough Muay Thai, I\u2019ve also built some connections and realized my body is capable of much more than I once thought. I\u2019ve competed a bit too\u2014won some fights, lost some fights\u2014but it\u2019s been a huge part of my growth. This year, I\u2019m hoping to get a tournament under my name, so I\u2019m more motivated than ever to get into fighting shape.\n\nThat brings me to now. I\u2019m 25, trying to rebuild parts of my life that I feel like I neglected for years. I\u2019ve made progress, but I still feel like I missed out on a lot of experiences growing up\u2014especially when it comes to dating and relationships.\n\nI\u2019ve only had one relationship in my life, and I\u2019m still a virgin at 25. People sometimes tell me I\u2019m attractive, but it\u2019s hard for me to believe it after everything I went through. I see others my age with a long history of relationships and experiences, while I barely have any. I\u2019m not desperate to jump into something, but I can\u2019t help feeling like I missed a big part of life.\n\nSo I guess my question is: did I waste my youth, or do I still have time to build the life I want? Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m starting way later than everyone else. Other times, I wonder if maybe I\u2019m beginning.",

I wake up, go to my IT job, complete my tasks, come home, distract myself for a bit, sleep, and repeat. Days blur together. Nothing feels new. Nothing feels meaningful.\n\nWhat worries me the most is not that I\u2019m failing , it\u2019s that I don\u2019t feel anything. I don\u2019t have any clear goals. Money doesn\u2019t excite me. Fitness doesn\u2019t. Meeting new people doesn\u2019t. Even hobbies I once enjoyed feel distant. I think about picking them up again, but there\u2019s no inner push. It feels like that version of me is gone.\n\nI also don\u2019t feel like I have much support. When I try to talk to my family about how I\u2019m feeling, their reaction is usually along the lines of \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Is this even a real problem?\u201d It makes me question myself. With friends, it feels like they\u2019re just spectators to my life rather than people I can genuinely open up to. And in work, it felt like the only thing that mattered was career and work life. No one really cared about what was happening internally or outside academics.\n\nFrom the outside, I\u2019m functioning. I go to work. I do what I\u2019m supposed to do. But inside, it feels empty like I\u2019m just existing instead of living.\n\nHas anyone experienced this kind of numbness and lack of direction? Did it turn out to be burnout, depression, or just a phase? What actually helped you move forward?\n\nI\u2019d really appreciate honest advice.",

    "selftext": "I hope you also found yourself in such situations where you were surrounded by circumstances where you had to fight. There was no other way, and mostly these situations occur in school, college, the most, but also in any or unexpected places in general. Because personally, I have been in such fights where mostly I had to get beaten because I wasn't that strong at that time. But as I learned and grew in such places, because honestly, I don't live in safe environments, it shaped a lot in me. You see, that's why I had to learn how to fight. Yes, a fight can happen anytime and anywhere, whether you're alone or with someone close. Life's unpredictable, my friend. There are bullies, there are thugs, and all of that chaos. In such a world, I would highly encourage you to learn how to fight. Yes, some people can't learn how to fight, but that's not the big problem here because in real-life fights, you are not fighting to prove something. You'll fight to protect yourself and your loved ones. In real fights, your focus mainly is to finish it as quickly as possible. Believe me, if you keep fighting, then something worse will happen because that's stupid in reality.\n\nIf you don't really have money, can't go to martial arts classes and etc., then no problem. I honestly didn't learn from those things as well. All you need to do is work out daily and start with boxing. It's best for beginners. Focus on stance, punches, form, not shallow or ego punching hard. Nope, that's not how it will work. Watch such moves on YouTube and learn from it, apply. And what I will highly recommend is to train your knuckles the most so that when you punch, you do it brutally. For that, knuckle push-ups, punching heavy bags, or etc. This way, you'll have those stronger punches than the average dudes. Do them daily, consistently, and as you keep watching the content around, you'll be much more able to take action on it properly, and you'll have better clarity as well.\n\nSo remember, you have to learn to fight. If you think you're safe today and won't get into one ever, then that's a delusion. As I said, life is unpredictable. Anything can happen. Shouldn't you be ready for that? So when it comes, you face it properly. Because from my perspective, I think you must have at least some kind of physicality, some strength, some skill to fight when needed. Otherwise, what's the point? I'm not encouraging you to go and seek fights. No, that's just not the way, and it's totally stupid. If you have anger, train. If you're frustrated, train. Utilize your energy, especially that anger, in your training at home. Believe me, once you start and get knowledge around it and actually apply it, stay consistent? You'll be much stronger than you are right now. And a quick thing here: don't get into any troubles, and if surrounded by gangs, try to escape and run rather than ego fighting. I hope this helps. Have a good day. Peace.",

    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been thinking a lot lately about how most of us grow up in a culture that revolves entirely around drinking and partying.\u00a0For most people my age, \"living life\" means clubs, raves, and holidays to places like Ibiza or Magaluf.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s the only side of life they\u2019ve ever seen, so they just assume it\u2019s the only one there is.\u00a0But there\u2019s another side that nobody really talks about.\u00a0I\u2019m talking about rooftop bars and decent restaurants.\u00a0Barcelona and Vienna.\u00a0Spending time in coffee shops in affluent areas instead of just sitting in a pub.\u00a0Going to a museum instead of a festival.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s not necessarily about one being \"better\" than the other, but it\u2019s crazy how most people never even realise this other side exists.\u00a0I don't think people miss out on it because they can't afford it; they miss out because it\u2019s never presented as an option.\u00a0Getting to that \"Other Side\" takes a lot of time and effort to build yourself up, but I\u2019ve found that once you actually experience it, you can\u2019t really go back to the crowd.\u00a0\n\nHas anyone else had this realisation? Like you just woke up one day and realised the standard lifestyle everyone else is chasing actually feels a bit empty?",

    "selftext": "A while ago I posted here about wanting to start a lofi/chill playlist channel because my 9\u20135 was draining me and I needed a creative outlet and some accountability.\n\nI'm working full-time, and for months I kept telling myself \"I'll start next week.\" I had the idea, I had the tools, but I never actually sat down and did it. Coming to this sub every day and reading other people's progress made me realize \u2014 I was stuck in planning mode.\n\nSo here's what I actually did:\n\n\\- Learned DaVinci Resolve from scratch (never edited video before)\n\n\\- Created original lofi jazz piano tracks\n\n\\- Designed a ghost character named Haru who's studying for an \"afterlife exam\" on a rainy night \ud83d\udc7b\ud83c\udf27\ufe0f\n\n\\- Built the whole channel \u2014 banner, profile, branding, SEO\n\n\\- Uploaded my first 1-hour lofi playlist video\n\nThe hardest part wasn't the technical stuff. It was pressing \"upload\" and accepting that it wouldn't be perfect. My first video has 2 subscribers watching it. And honestly? That's fine.\n\nWhat this sub taught me is that discipline isn't about motivation. It's about showing up even when the result looks embarrassing. So I showed up.\n\nMy plan going forward:\n\n\\- 1 long-form video per week\n\n\\- 2-3 shorts per week\n\n\\- Post updates here for accountability\n\nIf you're stuck in \"thinking mode\" like I was \u2014 just post your plan publicly. Even one commitment helps more than you think. The moment I told people I was doing this, quitting stopped being an option.\n\nThank you to everyone here. This sub genuinely helped me start.\n\n(Not sharing links unless asked \u2014 just wanted to say thanks and stay accountable.)",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI see so much stuff on the internet about productivity. Most of it is just people trying to sell you a course or a perfect image. They act like you need to have a special personality to succeed. They act like you should never feel stressed or overwhelmed.\n\nBut that is not how real life works. I wrote down some notes on how to build habits for actual humans who have low energy sometimes or get stressed easily.\n\n# Part 1: What is a habit?\n\nA habit is just practice and repetition. You do it until it becomes your second nature. When something is a habit, you do not need much conscious effort to get it done.\n\n**Why does your mind turn something into a habit?**\u00a0Your mind is always looking for a way to feel more pleasure and less pain. If you do an action over and over and your mind feels good about it, that action becomes a habit.\n\n**You can get that feeling of pleasure in two ways:**\n\n1. **By seeing yourself grow:**\u00a0When you track your progress, it is a benchmark. It makes your mind realize that you are literally moving forward.\n2. **By growing slowly:**\u00a0If you read 1 page yesterday and 1.2 pages today, that tiny bit of extra growth feels like a win.\n\n# Quick Notes: The Core Ideas\n\n* **Habit = Practice:**\u00a0Do it until you stop thinking about it.\n* **Effort:**\u00a0The goal is to make the conscious effort very low.\n* **The Mind:**\u00a0Associate the habit with pleasure, not pain.\n* **Tracking:**\u00a0It is proof for your brain that you are winning.\n* **Compounding:**\u00a0Small daily gains lead to big results.\n\n# Part 2: How to start building\n\nYou have to start small and start slow. You might see people online who never seem to get tired. Their personality might be different than yours. If you get overwhelmed easily, you need to be very practical.\n\nBe as precise as you can. Do not just say you will \"work out.\" Say exactly when and where.\n\n**Examples of being precise:**\n\n* I will read one page of my book in the morning while I am sipping my coffee. (The coffee is your Cue. Reading is the Action.)\n* I will do 25 minutes of strength training in the evening after I have my banana shake. (The shake is the Cue. Training is the Action.)\n\n**Congratulations if you are reading till here!**\u00a0It shows you actually want to change how you do things.\n\n# Part 3: How to keep it going\n\nMaintaining a habit is all about your mindset. You can download an app or use a notebook to track your progress. But the rules are simple:\n\n1. **If you skip a day, do not beat yourself up.**\u00a0Tell yourself it is okay and just pivot back to the habit the next day.\n2. **Do not miss more than a day or two.**\u00a0If you miss one day, it is a mistake. If you miss three days, it is a new habit of not doing it.\n3. **You will screw up multiple times and that is okay.**\n\nThis is how humans build consistency. You are just a human. Someday you will not feel like doing it. Someday you will go to a birthday party and forget. Someday you will be sick. That is all completely okay.\n\n# Summary: Making it effortless\n\nThe simple answer is to combine the two things we talked about. Start very small and be kind to yourself when you fail. If you do those two things, you are good to go.\n\n**At the last, it is all about implementation and execution. If you won't do anything, nothing will be changed.**\n\nIf you want me to touch any other topic tell me in the comments section, I'd love to help you guys.\n\nTill then, keep moving forward.",

    "selftext": "At one point this year I had Notion, Todoist, Habitica, Streaks, Day One, Bear, Evernote, Forest, Toggl, Structured, and Apple Reminders all on my phone. I was spending more time managing my systems than actually doing things. Classic r/getdisciplined trap.\n\nHere's what I replaced all of them with: \n\nHabit 1: Morning brain dump (5 min) Every morning while I make breakfast I just talk out loud about what's on my mind and what needs to happen today. I record it in Willow Voice and skim the transcript while I eat. I pull out the 3 most important things and write them on a sticky note that goes on my laptop. That's my to-do list for the day. Three things. If I get more done, great. But those three are the priority. \n\nHabit 2: Time blocking on paper (5 min) I have a weekly planner from Muji. Nothing digital. I block out my day in 2-hour chunks. Work, gym, errands, free time. If something isn't on the planner it doesn't happen and I've accepted that. Trying to fit everything in every day was making me feel like a failure constantly. \n\nHabit 3: End of day 2-minute review Before I close my laptop I write one sentence about what went well and one sentence about what I'll do differently tomorrow. In a plain text file. No fancy journal app. \n\nThat's it. Three habits, maybe 12 minutes total per day. I've been more consistent with this than I ever was with any app because there's almost zero friction. The moment a system requires me to open an app, navigate to the right page, and input data in a specific format, I'll do it for a week and then stop.\n\nI'm not saying apps are bad. They work for a lot of people. But if you're someone who keeps downloading new ones hoping the next one will fix your discipline problem, maybe the answer is less tech, not more. \n\nWhat's the simplest system that's actually working for you?",

    "selftext": "I have an endless list of things I want to do. In many ways, it feels like a gift. I\u2019m extremely curious and creative, and I never run out of ideas or projects. I\u2019ve accomplished meaningful things in my young career and I\u2019m building a startup that I genuinely believe will succeed.\n\nBut at the same time, I constantly feel \u201cclueless.\u201d Not about my potential I\u2019m confident in that but, about whether I\u2019m focusing on the right things and if i should even try to....\n\nI set goals and make structured plans, but I struggle to follow through consistently. My curiosity pulls me in new directions. I\u2019ll work incredibly hard, put in long hours, and juggle multiple projects, yet many of my short/medium-term goals don\u2019t fully materialize. I end up disappointed, even though I\u2019ve been productive.\n\nThe confusing part is that this same curiosity has taken me to incredible places. I often fail at the specific short-term goals I set, yet somehow achieve long-term outcomes that matter even more. It makes me question whether this is actually a flaw, or just a different operating system.\n\nLately, though, the stakes feel higher. I\u2019m at a stage in life where results matter more. My tendency to start 10 things and finish only some of them feels less charming and more costly. I worry that my \u201cinfinite curiosity loop\u201d is compounding into something negative. I constantly feel like I\u2019m not doing enough, not because I\u2019m lazy, but because I\u2019m not completing what I set out to do.\n\nI feel both confident and lost. Disciplined in effort, undisciplined in focus. Capable of exceptional output, yet frustrated with inconsistency.\n\nIs this just how some of us are wired? Do I need stricter systems and accountability? Or is this pattern actually part of how I grow and succeed?\n\nI\u2019m trying to understand whether I need to change myself or learn to work with how my mind already works.\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "Hi, so I\u2019ve actually never posted on here before. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll actually get answers, but here I go.\n\nI am a 20-year-old female and I live with my parents. I\u2019m in my last year of college and I\u2019m supposed to write my bachelor thesis for the upcoming presentation in a few months. Spoiler alert: I have done nothing since November 2025 on this (I barely wrote the first page). And this is only the top of the iceberg.\n\nFor a little bit of context, last year I got into the biggest fight with my mom ever. Long story short, she was always shitty (and I don\u2019t mean that in a spoiled brat daughter way). She hasn\u2019t cared about my education or health since I was 14, and even then she was like half of a parent. My dad was the supportive one... he pushed me forward, paid for my tutoring when I needed it, gave me money for school supplies and clothes, basically life essentials.\n\nAnd don\u2019t get me wrong, now that I\u2019m 20 I know I don\u2019t deserve and shouldn\u2019t get the same privileges as I did before. But I don\u2019t have a job. I cared so much about my grades and tried to get a scholarship (which I did, but only last year), even though I have nearly a perfect score in all subjects. I tutor kids and work occasionally to pay for food, clothes, and my mobile phone plan. I cook a few times per week for me and my parents and help with what I can. Yet my mom calls me a good-for-nothing because she cleans the house a lot more than me and whatnot.\n\nMy problem (which has really started to worry me) came up because of a fight we had today about this. For the last month or so after exam week passed, I\u2019ve been waking up at 4pm, watching series, eating, and doom-scrolling. All I\u2019ve spent money on these past weeks/months were gifts and \u201cnecessities\u201d (I hate calling razors, makeup products, kitchen jars and other crap useful things necessities). Meanwhile, I was supposed to: go to 2 doctor appointments last summer, fix my glasses, get my birth certificate that got lost, find my high school file with my diplomas in it, change my ID....\n\nAnd I did none of these things.\n\nThe problem is that I feel like she\u2019s right and I am a lazy, good-for-nothing person and daughter. I don\u2019t do shit. I used to volunteer and I\u2019ve really neglected that. Earlier this year I started waking up early and eating breakfast (which I\u2019ve never done before), but now, overall I am so much worse than I was a few years ago.\n\nIn my last year of high school, I was studying for finals, volunteering, doing theatre and debate club... and now I don\u2019t do anything. I have no interest in my health, I hate putting laundry away, I just rot in bed and have no motivation to change. I fear I will end up jobless and have no capacity to navigate through life, even though I felt like such a capable pontential-full person. Now I feel like I'm just too miserable to care and that reality is that I am extremely lazy, trying to find excuses for everyone simple thing that I can't do.",

Determine the things that you must do everyday to live up to your standard, and then its, are you doing those things or not?

Shortly after I moved, a friend had confessed he had feelings for me and wished I had told him what day I was leaving so that he could have told me in person. We dated for a few months. However, during that time, I had been emotionally abusing him because I was making him feel less important than some new friends I was making. At that time, I did not recognize how much that meant to him, so I had told him empty promises about doing better. But I was still hanging out with those friends. Whenever he brought it back up, I either did not say anything or made snarky remarks about his insecurities. This continued after we broke up. One month before the end of my internship, I had typed a poor attempt at giving him closure, and then ghosted him.\n\nWhen I arrived back, he showed up at my house, and we talked. About how much I had hurt him with the lies I told him with my promises, not taking accountability for the impact my actions had on him, and prioritizing others instead of him. For the next few months, we were still hanging out in voice calls. He even invited me to watch a movie, but I just didn't respond to it or bring it up. Then, I got a job back in that same city.\n\nBasically, I realize I hurt him by making empty promises even though I knew I was going to hang out with those friends again. I should have responded in a way that was both acknowledging of his pain but also that I was still going to hang out with my friends. I would definitely say my habit of wanting to avoid conflict did not help, and would like to hear if there are ways that could be useful for managing that better. But, I am wondering if I am being self-conceited in currently not seeing him as a friend anymore? It is not that I do not care about him, I don't care about him as much as before, and I feel like I am at my limit and cannot offer him any more repair for the hurt I caused.",

    "selftext": "I didn\u2019t grow up around entrepreneurs. Nobody taught me about investing. Nobody even talked about money in a serious way. I was just an 11-year-old kid who randomly searched \u201chow to make money online\u201d because something inside me refused the idea of living average.\n\nAt 11 I tried everything. Surveys. Random apps. YouTube ideas. Gaming income. Dropshipping fantasies. I made absolutely nothing. But I learned something dangerous at that age \u2014 money could be made on the internet without permission from anyone.\n\nThat idea never left.\n\nAt 13 I found Forex. Charts felt powerful. I remember thinking, \u201cIf I master this, I\u2019m free.\u201d I didn\u2019t understand risk. I didn\u2019t understand probability. I definitely didn\u2019t understand myself.\n\nFrom 13 to 16 I was addicted to the feeling of almost figuring it out. Every new strategy felt like the answer. RSI. MACD. Support and resistance. Smart money. ICT. Structure. Liquidity. Every month I thought I cracked the code. Every month I was wrong.\n\nWhen I started depositing real money at 16, reality hit fast. \u20ac50 gone. \u20ac100 gone. \u20ac200 gone. Not once. Multiple times. I wasn\u2019t losing because trading is impossible. I was losing because I had zero emotional discipline. I overleveraged. I revenge traded. I broke my own rules within days of creating them.\n\nNobody talks about that part. They just post the winning trade screenshot.\n\nAt 17, the hardest part wasn\u2019t losing money. It was watching people my age post profits online while I questioned whether I wasted years chasing something unrealistic. I had months in drawdown. Months where I felt stuck. Months where I doubted everything.\n\nHere\u2019s the uncomfortable truth I realized:\n\nMost traders don\u2019t fail because they lack strategy.  \nThey fail because they can\u2019t handle boredom, slow growth, and ego destruction.\n\nAt 18, I stopped trying to get rich. I started trying to survive.\n\nOne session.  \nFixed risk.  \nJournal everything.  \nNo signals.  \nNo Discord hopping.  \nNo \u201cnew strategy of the month.\u201d\n\nTrading became boring. Structured. Mechanical.\n\nThat\u2019s when it started improving.\n\nOver the years I\u2019ve probably deposited over \u20ac1,000 total across accounts. I\u2019ve had +20% months. +30% months. I\u2019ve also had -25% months and long break-even periods. Nothing about this was linear. There was no magical turning point. Just gradual reduction of stupidity.\n\nNow I\u2019m 19. I\u2019m not a millionaire. I\u2019m not selling courses. I\u2019m not claiming I \u201cmade it.\u201d But I didn\u2019t quit. And that alone already eliminates most people.\n\nIf you\u2019re in this game for fast money, you won\u2019t last.  \nIf you\u2019re in this game for ego validation, you won\u2019t last.  \nIf you can\u2019t handle looking stupid for years, you won\u2019t last.\n\nThe market doesn\u2019t care about your age. It doesn\u2019t care how long you\u2019ve been studying. It only cares about discipline and execution.\n\nI started at 11.\n\nEight years later, I\u2019m still here.\n\nHow many people can say the same?\n\nBe honest \u2014 how long have you been trading, and what\u2019s the hardest part for you?",

    "selftext": "I've been thinking about this for a while and I genuinely don't have a clean answer, which is why I want to hear other people's experience.\n\nFor context: I've been consistently working out 4-5 times a week for almost two years now. I don't think about it, I don't negotiate with myself, it just happens. But my eating habits over that same period have been genuinely embarassing. Not terrible, but inconsistent in a way that feels almost random. I'll be solid for three weeks and then spend a weekend eating like I'm trying to set a record.\n\nWhat confuses me is that these aren't different resources I'm drawing from, or at least they shouldn't be. It's the same brain, the same schedule, theoretically the same capacity for follow-through. But the discipline just doesn't transfer.\n\nMy current theory is that it has less to do with willpower and more to do with how clearly the identity is formed. I genuinely think of myself as \"someone who works out.\" I don't have an equivalent identity anchor for food. So when things get stressful or chaotic, the workout survives because it's load-bearing for how I see myself, and the eating just... doesn't have that protection.\n\nBut I'm not fully convinced by my own theory. Because I know people who have rock solid nutrition and treat exercise like an optional extra. So maybe it's not about identity formation at all, maybe its about which habits came first or which ones have more visible short-term feedback.\n\nHas anyone actually managed to transfer discipline from one domain to another intentionally? Not just \"got better at two things at once\" but actually used one working system to bootstrap another?",

    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been dealing with a recurring issue lately, or I should say all my life to be honest, and wanted to document an attempt to address it.\n\nI tend to not be very mindful of how I use my time, and I keep complaining that I\u2019m losing it. This creates a negative loop that often leads to self judgment and low mood.\n\nSmartphones are especially problematic for people like me. They lure me in with something that appears meaningful, but by the time I reach for the phone, my attention has already started drifting.  \nHowever, I\u2019ve realized the issue isn\u2019t limited to smartphones. Almost any activity can become a way to move away from what I had originally intended to do.\n\nThe difficulty seems to be less about distraction itself, and more about noticing when my attention has shifted.\n\nWithout noticing that shift, it becomes hard to distinguish between, an activity I consciously chose vs an activity I drifted into to avoid something else\n\nSo I\u2019ve been trying to make those shifts more visible.\n\nI initially started tracking consistency using small **stones** placed in **3 bowls,** I call them my superbowls. Touching them added a physical component that helped me feel more grounded.\n\nThere was no minimum time requirement. The goal was simply to show up.\n\nOver time though, I noticed that I was sometimes doing the bare minimum just to place a stone. Writing a few words became enough to maintain the streak.\n\nSo I introduced a timer, mainly to see how long I was actually spending on a task.\n\nThis helped me notice the time invested and made me less likely to stop after a few seconds.\n\nBut I also noticed that my attention would sometimes drift while the timer was still running. I had started intentionally, but ended up doing something else without realizing it.\n\nThe time kept accumulating even though the activity had changed.\n\nSo I added a simple table where I manually log time in 5 minute blocks by activity.\n\nNot to track productivity, but to make attention shifts visible.\n\nNow, when I move from one activity to another, I have to record it.  \nThat small step often makes the transition explicit enough for me to reconsider it.\n\nOver time, the total time logged became less important than noticing when I had drifted. Logging doesn\u2019t prevent distraction, but it makes it visible sooner\n\nAnd once it\u2019s visible, I can choose whether to continue or return to the task I had originally decided to work on.\n\nInterestingly, the timer has also become a kind of mental reference point.\n\nEven when I don\u2019t have it nearby, I sometimes find myself imagining pressing the button before starting an activity and asking whether I actually want to dedicate time to it.\n\nThat brief pause is often enough to make the decision explicit rather than automatic.\n\nI am posting this as part of trying to stay accountable.\n\nI do feel a strong reluctance in doing so, but since starting this process I\u2019ve managed to break a few internal barriers that allowed me to move forward.\n\nI know I tend to abandon things, and I would like to avoid reproducing that pattern, because the cost has been too high in terms of self esteem.\n\nI also need to limit myself to weekly updates, otherwise this could easily become another distraction.",

Gym buddies. Study groups. AA meetings. The common thread is always the same \u2014 other people knowing. Not judging. Just knowing.\n\nSo I built an app around this idea. Small anonymous groups of 8 people, all trying to stop scrolling. You block your problem apps, get limited access in small time windows, and your group can see your progress. There's a chat. You're not reporting to an app \u2014 you're accountable to real people going through the same thing.\n\nThe problem is, the whole concept only works when there are enough people to fill groups. I need more people just to see if this actually holds up in practice.\n\nIf anyone's on iOS and wants to help me test this, DM me.

    "selftext": "I\u2019m not entirely sure how long this will go on for, or how many typos I\u2019ll make, but here goes. I feel a bit daft typing this out for a group of strangers, especially knowing the advice might be a bit hit-and-miss. However, I can feel a major depressive episode looming on the horizon. I know my own patterns; I can sense when things are starting to go south well before they actually do. Since I don't really have anyone to lean on, I thought I\u2019d reach out here in the hopes that someone might be able to shed some light on the questions I\u2019ve been sitting with for years.\n\nFor a bit of context, I\u2019ve struggled with social anxiety my entire life. It started off as being \"quirky\" when I was little, morphed into being an \"annoying burden\" to my family in my teens, and has now settled into a \"crippling deficit\" in my young adult years. As the second child in a very strict household, the pressure from my parents to excel academically was relentless. My relationship with them, my mother in particular, has always been strained. She constantly projected her own childhood trauma and the academic pressure she faced onto me. Perhaps that\u2019s why I felt destined for failure from such an early age.\n\nBy secondary school, I had severe insomnia. I\u2019d rarely get a full night\u2019s sleep, and I remember the moment summer holidays hit, I\u2019d sleep for three days straight, only waking up for a bit of lunch. My mum would absolutely lose it at me for that. My social skills remained poor, compounded by the constant dread of getting average marks and an inability to even leave my room. To give you an idea of how bad the anxiety is, I\u2019ve never been able to run errands properly; I can\u2019t look a cashier in the eye or tell a waiter my order. I can\u2019t stand being the centre of attention. If someone initiates a conversation, you\u2019ll likely see me physically backing away, hoping they\u2019ll take the hint that I\u2019m uncomfortable. I\u2019m not trying to be rude; it\u2019s just that being thrust into social situations is incredibly taxing.\n\nI\u2019m currently seeing a psychiatrist and a psychologist, but our sessions usually consist of me shutting down or dissociating. On the rare \"good\" days, I can talk about my feelings, but other times I find myself lying just to appease them. Consequently, I feel like their decisions, especially regarding my medication, aren't doing much. I\u2019m still stuck in this cycle of depression and social paralysis.\n\nI\u2019m now in my final year of uni. My grades are exceedingly decent enough, can't complain, though I\u2019m struggling with new issues, like having to sleep all evening just to recover from being outdoors in the morning. I honestly can\u2019t see a future for myself. I\u2019m being pressured by my parents and society to chase a high-paying job just to live comfortably, but that isn\u2019t what I want. I\u2019m not quite suicidal, but I do struggle with ideation quite often. I\u2019ve wondered if I might be neurodivergent, but my parents and professionals always brushed it off because I was \"too functional.\"\n\nI just want an honest answer or some insight so I can figure out how to actually exist in society. It feels ridiculous that I have to sleep for hours just to recover from the basic act of being a functioning young adult for a few hours.\nIf anyone has any thoughts or has been through something similar, I\u2019d really appreciate it. I'm not looking for a diagnosis, just a bit of direction.",

    "selftext": "For about two years I approached every new habit the same way: pick something, commit hard, fail around day ten, restart from zero feeling worse than before. I kept reading that discipline is built through consistency so every time I broke the streak I assumed I just lacked willpower and needed to try harder next time. The harder I tried the shorter the streaks got. I started a study routine in September with two hours every evening, missed one day because of a group project that ran long, and then somehow didn't open my notes for eleven days after that. Not because I was lazy, I genuinley wanted to study, but something about breaking the streak made starting again feel heavier than starting from scratch had felt originally.\n\n\n\nThe shift happened when I stopped thinking about it as building something new and started thinking about it as recovering something damaged. An injured muscle doesn't need you to push harder, it needs smaller movements done consistently until it trusts load again. I cut my study sessions to 35 minutes, made the only rule that I open my notes every single day regardless of how long I actually worked, and stopped tracking streaks completley. The first two weeks felt almost embarrassingly small. But I haven't had an eleven day gap in three months and the sessions have naturaly gotten longer without me deciding to extend them. I don't think I had a discipline problem. I think I had a recovery protocol problem the whole time.",

I recognize the issues but keep falling back into them.\n\nRomantic relationships can bring out a toxic needy person in me. My 3 year relationship wasn\u2019t perfect but I relied on him too much with my problems and argued so much to the point he became depressed and avoided coming home to me. \n\nWhen I told my mother about a lot the things on my mind in regards to the break up she gave me a tough love moment.\n\nLong story short she told me I\u2019m holding on overthinking and making excuses for myself. She told me no one is gonna save me but myself. My mom said she\u2019s not gonna be here long as she is elderly so I better get my act together. \n\nI sometimes just want a shoulder to cry on but she isn\u2019t that type of person so silly of me to keep looking for that when it comes to the same problems. \n\nI\u2019ve been in therapy since 17 after I got molested and while I\u2019ve made progress, I\u2019ve backslid a lot.\n\nI struggle with self compassion, forgiveness and gratitude.\n\nIn my heart I feel I\u2019m doing everything wrong.\n\nI have very happy moments in my life but my lows can be in hell.\n\nI take medication and go to therapy as well.

She is patient and mellow and does not judge me for crying about my pain in our sessions. I appreciate that grace she gives me.\n\nMaybe I am holding on to my pain too much. When I get triggered it takes a while for me to come back from the initial upset. I could have the best day and one trigger, one reminder of my ex or my trauma can ruin my mood. \n\nTLDR: I want to fully heal from my trauma and not be an emotional wreck. ",

    "selftext": "Alright, this is going to sound super awkward, but here\u2019s the full story. I went to the doctor because I was completely unmotivated, hadn\u2019t hit a growth spurt, and was losing a ton of hair. I felt like my body was betraying me, and honestly, I was scared something was seriously wrong.\n\nThe doctor ran blood tests and a brain scan. When he saw my results, he leaned back and said, \u201cThis looks like the brain of someone who does heroin.\u201d I froze. I was like, \u201cNo\u2026 I don\u2019t do that\u2026\u201d and he awkwardly chuckled, then said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay to touch yourself here and there\u2026 but you\u2019re going way overboard.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, I wanted to disappear. He could literally see my brain had been rewired by overstimulation \u2014 I was gooning 5 times a day, sometimes even before \n\nschool, after school, late at night \u2014 basically all day if I didn\u2019t have classes. He said my dopamine levels were so low they were below baseline, which explained why I was so lazy, unfocused, and demotivated.\n\nThen he started going into the serial effects of it. He explained that overstimulation messes with, Motivation for school or work, Emotional control why I\u2019d get frustrated at tiny things, Social confidence why talking to people felt exhausting, Even physical development why my growth spurt was delayed\n\nHe showed me the brain scan images, pointing out areas that looked underactive, and I couldn\u2019t believe it. I felt exposed and embarrassed, but also\u2026 kind of relieved. I finally understood why I\u2019d been stuck for so long.\n\nFor the hair loss, my vitamin D was insanely low, basically deficient. After taking it consistently, tiny hairs started growing back. By 6 months, my hair was thicker than it had been in years.\n\nThe height thing was nuts too \u2014 stretching, posture work, and consistent sleep actually helped me grow 6cm taller. My energy and focus were completely different. I could wake up early, do schoolwork, and not feel like a zombie.\n\nHonestly, that awkward doctor visit changed my life. Stopping gooning, fixing deficiencies, and building small daily habits turned me from a completely unmotivated mess into someone who finally felt like me again.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m super embarrassed, but should I even change doctors after this? I feel like he saw way too much one thing I didn\u2019t want toReally add so I kept it\n\nIn the end haha is that because of Excess gooning I had extreme ED and a big mould that built up as I don\u2019t clean up after as I was silly and angry at myself for it and my parents don\u2019t know right. But my mom Had my circumcision booked and I don\u2019t know how to tell her it\u2019s unsafe for me to get it right now. So we went in clinic and I thought at least my mum won\u2019t be there to see and I\u2019ll ask workers to\n\nKeep it a secret but my mom who I\u2019m not close with at all wanted to come See me get it done as she says it\u2019s part of our culture and when she saw the mould and my ed as the injections couldn\u2019t really work for me as not much blood flow she shamed me to my brothers and father now my whole family knows lol I tried to make\n\nUp every excuse but I gave up and just came clean. \n\nWhy do some parents think it\u2019s okay to\n\nEmbarrass their kids like that I\u2019m fully grown and hit puberty men. Well at least the bright side is now\n\nI\u2019m super disciplined my hair is back I\u2019m Taller school\n\nIs great and haven\u2019t gooned in months. But how do\n\nI get rid of that awkward moment with family now lol \n\npoint of message is stop gooning lol ",

This too will pass.   \n**Accept reality as it is.** Don\u2019t run away. I fell. It\u2019s okay. What can I do now to fix it? Don\u2019t be discouraged.   \n**A fall is just an opportunity to get back up.** As the Japanese proverb says: \u201cFall seven times, get up eight.\u201d   \n**Stop exaggerating a fall.** Change your mindset. It\u2019s just a \u201cdrop in the ocean.\u201d   \n**Be grateful for everything.** With gratitude, optimism is sustainable.   \n  \n*If falling is an accident, but staying down is a choice - how many times have you consciously chosen to stay down?*",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone! I could really use some perspective.\n\nA couple years ago I lived very day-to-day. I didn\u2019t schedule much, I just ran on motivation and did things when I felt like it. Then I met my boyfriend, who plans his life hour-by-hour on a whiteboard. I tried adopting his system and at first I liked it, but eventually it started stressing me out.\n\nHe had a lot more structured commitments than I did, so I often felt like I \u201cwasn\u2019t doing enough.\u201d That led to some insecurity on my end and honestly made me feel unmotivated and not good enough.\n\nFast forward to 2026.. I dropped the hourly whiteboard planning and switched to a daily schedule journal template instead. That feels way better for me. But now I\u2019m stuck on something else:\n\nI have a lot of genuine passions, and I don\u2019t know how to structure progress in all of them without spreading myself too thin.\n\nHere\u2019s what I care about:\n\n**Career:**\n\n* I want to pursue acting seriously and eventually turn it into a money-making career.\n* I also want to become a licensed esthetician and possibly run some type of skincare consultation business alongside acting. I genuinely love skincare and helping people.\n\n**Lifestyle / Growth:**\n\n* Yoga \n* Pilates + treadmill \n* Golf (to bond with my boyfriend and get good at it in general)\n* Personal finance + investing (I want to be financially literate and smart with money while I\u2019m young, especially as a woman)\n* French (I want to level up this year)\n\nMy struggle is:  \nHow do you realistically make progress in multiple areas???? why does this feel so confusing and overwhelming. \n\nDo you:\n\n* Study something every single day?\n* Assign certain days to certain topics?\n* Rotate weekly focuses?\n* Pick only 1\u20132 main priorities and let the rest grow slowly?\n\nI tried assigning each passion to one day a week, but someone told me that doing something only once a week won\u2019t create real growth.... which might be true?\n\nI don\u2019t want to feel scattered.

I just want a sustainable system where I feel like I\u2019m genuinely progressing in the things that matter to me.\n\nIf you\u2019re someone who juggles multiple ambitions, how do you structure your time? What has actually worked long-term?\n\nThank you \ud83e\udef6",

Anyway my family 100% believes im lying about being clean mostly my sisters and my mother (drama queens/sh*t starters) they talk bad about me all week to people and some of those people reach out to me and talk down on me and its just so frustrating people love having my di*k in their mouth and always worry about wtf im doing, they call me and keep \"offering jobs\" like throwing jobs in my face kinda like \"fix your life get this job you have no excuse\" but when i say i have a dam job nobody believes me. My nephew hes 12 and lives with me and my father cuz my father spoils tf out of him yes hes my sisters kid. He tells my mom and my sisters i dont have a job cuz he sees me everyday all day but my job is 12am -8am so he neverbsees me go to work or come home cuz when im off work hes in school and then comes home and sees me all day. I showed everyone my check stubs, bank deposits, they think they are fake, they think my car is stolen and cuz its not a brand new 2025 car, its a 2002 toyota highlander, they talk bad about my car. My sisters boyfriend also talks so much sh*t behind my back to my nephew and my nephew of course plays both sides of the fence he comes tells me but her bf wont say sh*t to my face when i confront him.

    "selftext": "[](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/?f=flair_name%3A%22Advice%20Needed%3A%20Mental%20Health%22)\n\nHello everyone, I'm 25 and recently graduated from university ( I know, such a failure). It's all because of my hesitation to clearly choose for myself what career to pursue. Long story short, I got a scholarship from a university to a major that I don't particularly like, but just because of the scholarship i stay with it, and I really like i seriously don't like it. I want to change it to something else, but I don't know what I want anymore, so my parents just advised me to stay with the current major and graduate with it, then do it with something new after that. However, since I don't really like to study it, I procrastinate to study so badly that my academic life is miserable. I isolate myself in front of the computer, watching movies on YouTube, and looking at other people's lives through social media. It has become an addiction i don't even know when. I wake up till 4 am to just watch YouTube content. I felt terribly bad about it. I tried everything I could to stop myself. Put the computer away, set a time block, and give other people the passcode so I don't know how to open it, but it becomes so bad as an addict will always try to find the heroin when the urge arises. I wasted a lot of my youth on this. The important thing is I still don't know what to do with my life. I graduated with a C gpa. The reason for the dragout of my time in university is that my parents want me to study a master's and advance my academic life with a major that I don't like ( asian parent). They always say they feel so proud that I am capable of studying such a difficult major(applied math) and wish for me to go further with the major. But I have long grown a huge resentment toward this major, but if I don't do this for them, I feel like an ungrateful brat. I already have some connections who are willing to help me get accepted in master's program by doing a good research paper eventhough I totally doubt that I can with the GPA I have. I totally sound like a kid, so immature when I think about it, but I guess I have to find a way to get out of this, but I can't. I am procrastinating on everything now, just watching Youtube first in the morning, going to work, going to the gym, then back to watch Youtube. If this goes on i don't know how much longer I can keep myself from doing a stupid thing like offing myself. I totally lost, I can't just keep this unhealthy routine every day. I am throwing my life away but i don't want it so I am very kindly asking everyone for help with the situation. I procrastinate on what to do and I also don't know what I want to do with my life. Please, I need your guidance and advice. Thank you very much.\n\n[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1r9keob)",

    "selftext": "Every January I swear everyone becomes a different person. Gyms are packed, people are suddenly meal prepping, writing goals, planning routines, all of it. Motivation is everywhere.\n\nThen a few weeks pass and real life starts again. Work gets busy, stress creeps in, energy drops, and slowly people fall back into old habits. I used to do the same thing every year. What finally clicked for me is that discipline isn\u2019t built when motivation is high. It\u2019s built on random boring days when you don\u2019t feel like doing anything and you still show up anyway.\n\nThe biggest thing that helped me was stopping relying on motivation. You\u2019re never going to feel motivated every single day. If you wait until you feel like it, you\u2019ll stay stuck. I started treating my habits like non negotiables, the same way I treat brushing my teeth or going to work. You just do it. I also stopped trying to change everything at once. Every time I tried to go all in, I\u2019d burn out after two weeks. Now I focus on small things I can actually stick to. Short workouts. One healthy meal. Going to bed a bit earlier. Small stuff adds up way faster than people realize.\n\nAnother shift was identity. Instead of thinking \u201cI\u2019m trying to be disciplined,\u201d I started thinking \u201cI\u2019m someone who shows up even when I don\u2019t feel like it.\u201d That mindset change honestly made things way easier. Also, discipline is boring. Progress is slow. There\u2019s no hype most days. Once I accepted that, it stopped feeling like something was wrong. That\u2019s just how it works.\n\nAnd probably the most important part, learning to restart fast. One bad day doesn\u2019t matter. Letting one bad day turn into a bad week or month is what ruins everything. Now if I slip, I just reset the next day and keep going.\n\nDiscipline is really just choosing what you want most over what you want now. If you can stay consistent when motivation is gone, you\u2019ll be shocked how much your life can change in a year.",

The Automatic Monthly Transfer**\n\nI set up an automatic $100 transfer to my savings every month on the 1st. It adds up over time and keeps me from spending the money since \"I don't see it\". I keep it in a high-yield savings account (I use\u00a0Forbright\u00a0for the 3.85% APY, but any HYSA works) so it grows on its own.\n\n**3. Using apps that don't feel like \"work\"**\n\nI realized I only stick to habits if they\u2019re actually engaging. I didn't even try Excel because I prefer apps that feel more like a game. I\u2019ve been using\u00a0Pawket\u00a0lately, which is unique.

I\u2019m trying to build more habits this year and would love to hear what worked for you.",

    "selftext": "Hi all! It goes a bit deeper than the title, but that's the gist of it.\n\nThere was recently a health crisis in my immediate family which I believe may have evoked childhood trauma. The crisis is ongoing, and there is a lack of information that has me in a state of consistent anxiety.\n\nI've always been an A/B student, and I take some of the hardest classes offered at my school. This crisis started close to the start of the second semester of my senior year, so for about the past month I have had little to no motivation.\n\nRight now, for example, I have four English assignments I need to get done, and about 35 History questions (accompanied by 14 pages of reading). I'm not too worried about the English; I love English and the assignments are easy. History is my main concern. The reading is dense, and I've fallen behind to a point where I sometimes struggle to understand even the basics of what I'm reading. The questions are difficult, too, at least for me.\n\nI'm also concerned about Biology, as science is the one subject I have never found any interest in.\n\nIt's not really a problem of doom-scrolling. I don't have much of a desire to be on my phone. I'll just sit and stare at a wall and think about how I *should* be doing homework, but I don't care enough to start, and everything feels pointless. I feel extremely exhausted, physically and mentally, after coming home from school. I sit and do nothing for hours, and every so often I'll think to myself \"you just wasted an hour\" and hate myself a little bit.\n\nSorry if any of this is confusing, and let me know if more clarification is required.\n\nTL;DR: Ongoing lack of motivation combined by sudden loss of that panic feeling that often cures procrastination. I need to figure out how to do school work that feels extremely daunting after falling behind.",

(Opening up your laptop to book a dentist appointment and two hours later you are down the best youtube rabbit hole ever...you know the drill..)\n\nIt's a simple chrome extension that works by setting a task for a specific time, which blocks a pre-entered list of websites. You can also get your friend/family to password protect it so there is more friction and external accountability!\n\nIt\u2019s $3.99/month because I\u2019m trying to grow it properly (not a VC thing, just me and a friend). My goal is to get 20 early users to test it and give honest feedback.\n\nIf this sounds helpful for you/interested then please get in touch. I'd really appreciate some early adopters!!\n\nAlso curious - what's been really helpful in terms of stopping distraction on your laptop? (specifically in my case it's youtube and reddit)\n\nWishing y'all a lovely day!",

My habits felt random and I couldn't find the pattern.\n\nThen I started paying attention to what I did in the first 20 minutes after walking through the door.\n\nOn the good evenings, I had changed clothes within the first few minutes, drank some water, and done one small physical thing \u2014 even just washing the dishes from the morning. On the bad evenings, I had sat down \"just for a second\" with my phone while still in my work clothes.\n\nThat's it. That was basically the entire difference.\n\nI think what's happening is that the transition from work to home is a genuine state change that your brain needs help completing. If you give it a low-effort escape hatch right at that moment \u2014 the couch, the phone, the TV \u2014 it takes it, and then it's very hard to shift gears again because you've already started winding down. But if you do something small and physical first, you're telling your brain the day isn't over yet and there's still a different kind of energy available.\n\nI now have a very short \"landing routine\" that took embarassingly long to figure out: shoes off, change clothes, glass of water, one small task. Takes maybe 12 minutes total. It sounds almost insultingly simple but my evenings are genuinely unrecognisable compared to a year ago.\n\nThe transition moment is the leverage point. Most people try to fix their evenings by planning better or having more willpower at 9pm. But by 9pm the decision was already made 5 hours earlier in those first 20 minutes.",

    "selftext": "When I was a kid, I wanted to become an astronaut.\n\nNot because of space itself, but because astronauts represented control. Discipline. The ability to go further than normal people, both physically and mentally.\n\nFor a long time, I believed I was on that path.\n\nI was close to graduation. I had direction. I believed in love. I believed in the future.\n\nThen everything collapsed.\n\nThe first girl I ever truly loved slowly destroyed herself with drugs. I stayed. I tried to help her. I gave everything I had to keep her safe. But in the end, she chose someone else.\n\nAt one point, during an argument, she tried to stab me. And she told me something I never forgot \u2014 that nobody would believe me. That I looked like someone people wouldn\u2019t protect (she meant the police).\n\nSomething in me broke that day. Quietly.\n\nAround the same time, I was helping my family financially, even though I was the middle child who never even had something as simple as a birthday celebration. I gave what I could, believing that loyalty meant something.\n\nBut eventually, I was still forced out. Suddenly, I had no stable place to go. I slept in random places, moving constantly, pretending I was fine while everything inside me was collapsing.\n\nAfter that, I stopped believing in stability. I stopped believing in love. I stopped believing in the version of myself I was building toward.\n\nInstead, I chased control in other ways.\n\nI pushed my body to extremes. Brutal workouts. Daily ice baths. Not to grow, but to escape. Sometimes I stayed in the cold longer than I should have, half-hoping my heart would just stop so the noise in my head would finally go quiet.\n\nWhen that wasn\u2019t enough, I chased distraction. Sex. Validation. Attention. Temporary escapes that made me feel powerful for a moment, but emptier afterwards.\n\nI even pushed away people who genuinely cared about me.\n\nOn paper, I was successful. I made money. I looked strong. But inside, I had no peace. No direction. No control.\n\nThe astronaut I once wanted to become felt like someone who never existed.\n\nEventually, I realized something difficult.\n\nNo one was coming to rebuild me.\n\nIf I wanted control back, I had to rebuild it myself. Slowly. One decision at a time.\n\nSo I started with something small. Just sitting down and completing focus sessions, even when my mind resisted. Treating focus like training. Like reps.\n\nTo make it real, I built a simple app for myself. Inside it, there\u2019s a small astronaut that progresses every time I complete a focus session. It\u2019s not really about the software itself. It\u2019s about what it represents.\n\nEvery time I open it and see that astronaut moving forward, it reminds me that progress is still possible. That the person I once believed I could become isn\u2019t gone.\n\nJust waiting.\n\nI\u2019m 25 now.\n\nI lost years. I lost people. I lost parts of myself.\n\nBut maybe I didn\u2019t lose everything.\n\nMaybe discipline isn\u2019t something you find.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s something you rebuild.\n\nI hope I will overcome all my demons one day and I wish everyone much strength while facing your own...",

Deadlines, deliverables, things with a clear \"done\" state - I handle them fine. I don't procrastinate much, I follow through, people count on me. That version of me feels pretty functional.\n\nBut then there's everything else. The novel I've been \"working on\" for two years with 4,000 words written. The programming language I want to learn that I open and close every few weeks. The fitness goal that restarts every month. None of these have a boss, a due date, or consequences if I quietly abandon them for another week.\n\nAnd I think that's exactly the problem. My brain seems to need external structure to actually move. Without it I go into this weird mode where I do a lot of thinking about the thing, maybe some planning, ocasionally watch a youtube video about someone else doing the thing - and then just dont. The intention is always there. The motion almost never is.\n\nI've tried giving myself fake deadlines and it doesn't really work because some part of me knows they're fake. I've tried accountability partners but I feel so guilty when I inevitably let it slip that I end up avoiding the person instead of the task.\n\nWhat actually works for people who are wired this way?

Every scroll might show you something good. So your brain says: keep going.\n\nA big project puts the reward weeks away. No clear payoff in sight. So starting feels like pushing a boulder uphill.\n\nSame brain. Same person. The only difference is how far away the reward is.\n\nYour brain only wants to do things that pay off soon.\n\nSo all you need to change is which rewards can reach you and when.\n\nWhat I learned and what helps me tremendously:\n\n1. Your morning sets the bar. Cheap dopamine early makes your brain chase it all day. Hard-lock distracting apps for your first 60-90 minutes.\n2. Start a focus timer before deep work. Your brain starts chasing the pride you feel when the timer ends regardless of the task. Do this enough and it begs for more.\n3. Schedule hard-locks during work hours. When your brain knows Instagram isn't available, it stops comparing. Work becomes the closest reward by default.\n\nHope this helps some of you",

    "selftext": "I used to think the reason I wasn't getting things done was because I was too easy on myself. So I got harder. Stricter deadlines. Harsher self-talk. More consequences for failing.\n\nIt made everything worse.\n\nEvery time I missed a workout, I'd call myself lazy. Every time I procrastinated, I'd spiral into \"what's wrong with you, you had one thing to do.\" I thought this was accountability. Holding myself to a standard. Being disciplined.\n\nTurns out it was just punishment. And punishment doesn't build habits. It builds avoidance.\n\nThere's this thing in behavioral psychology about how negative reinforcement actually works. When you punish yourself for failing, your brain doesn't go \"better try harder next time.\" It goes \"that whole experience was painful, let's not trigger it again.\" So you don't avoid the failure. You avoid the attempt.\n\nWhich means the harder you are on yourself for skipping the gym, the more your brain associates \"gym\" with feeling like garbage. So you avoid it. Then you feel worse. So you're harder on yourself. Then you avoid it more.\n\nI started calling this the **punishment spiral**. You fail, you beat yourself up, the beating makes the thing feel worse, so you avoid it harder, so you fail more, so you beat yourself up more. The discipline you think you're applying is actually the thing keeping you stuck.\n\nThis is maybe the fifth or sixth loop like this I've noticed running in the background. Starting to think half my \"motivation problems\" were just self-inflicted wounds I kept reopening.\n\nThe shift that actually worked wasn't being easier on myself in some soft, self-compassion way. It was just being neutral. I missed the workout. Okay. That happened. When's the next one? No story about what it means about me as a person. No invented consequences to \"teach myself a lesson.\"\n\nJust: that happened. Here's the next opportunity. Do I want to take it?\n\nIt felt wrong at first. Like I was letting myself off the hook. But here's the thing. The hook wasn't helping. It was just painful. Pain doesn't create consistency. It creates flinching.\n\nReal discipline isn't being hard on yourself. It's showing up repeatedly without all the emotional drama attached. The drama is what makes it unsustainable. You can only white-knuckle through self-hatred for so long before your brain opts out entirely.\n\nI still miss workouts sometimes. But I don't lose three days to the spiral anymore. And weirdly, removing the punishment made me more consistent than years of being \"tough on myself\" ever did.\n\nThat voice that calls you lazy after every slip? It's not helping you. It's just loud. And you've been mistaking volume for usefulness.",

    "selftext": "I realized I was optimizing my entire life for comfort and it was destroying me.\n\nEverything in my apartment was designed to make things easier. Food delivered to my door so I didn\u2019t have to leave. Entertainment one click away so I never got bored. Work from home so I never had to go anywhere. My whole life was frictionless and I thought that was good.\n\nI\u2019m 26. For the past two years I\u2019d been removing every bit of difficulty from my existence. Didn\u2019t want to cook so I ordered every meal. Didn\u2019t want to be bored so I had infinite content at my fingertips. Didn\u2019t want to feel uncomfortable so I never did anything that required effort.\n\nMy life was easy and I was completely miserable.\n\nI had no discipline because I never had to exercise it. No resilience because I never faced difficulty. No growth because I never pushed myself. Just endless comfort that felt good moment to moment but left me empty and weak.\n\nI\u2019d wake up, work from my bed, order lunch, watch stuff, order dinner, consume content until I fell asleep. Repeat daily. Zero resistance anywhere in my life. Zero challenge. Zero growth.\n\nTwo months ago I was lying in bed at 3pm on a Saturday scrolling my phone with food wrappers around me and I realized I\u2019d become completely soft. Not just physically but mentally. I couldn\u2019t handle any discomfort at all. The smallest inconvenience felt unbearable because my entire life was engineered to avoid it.\n\nThat\u2019s when I decided to do the opposite. Remove every comfort. Add friction everywhere. Make everything harder. Force myself to build the discipline and resilience I\u2019d completely lost.\n\nWhat I actually did\n\nRemoved all convenience from my life\n\nFirst thing I did was delete every app that made life easy. Food delivery apps gone. All of them. DoorDash, Uber Eats, everything. If I wanted food I\u2019d have to go get it or cook it.\n\nStreaming services deleted. Netflix, YouTube, all of it. If I wanted entertainment I\u2019d have to actually go somewhere or do something that required effort.\n\nGot rid of my car for the 60 days. Gave the keys to a friend. If I needed to go somewhere I\u2019d walk or take public transit. No more driving two minutes to avoid a ten minute walk.\n\nAdded mandatory daily discomfort\n\nEvery single day I had to do something uncomfortable. Not dangerous, just uncomfortable. Cold showers every morning. Going to the gym even when I didn\u2019t feel like it. Talking to strangers. Anything that made me want to avoid it.\n\nUsed this app called Reload to structure the whole thing. It built me a 60 day plan with increasing challenges each week. Week one challenges were small discomforts. Week eight challenges were things that genuinely scared me.\n\nAlso used it to block everything that let me take the easy path. Blocked food delivery sites, blocked all streaming and social media. Made comfort impossible so I had to face discomfort.\n\nForced myself to do everything the hard way\n\nNeeded groceries? Walk 20 minutes to the store, carry them back. No quick drive.\n\nWanted coffee? Walk to a coffee shop, order in person, talk to the barista. No mobile order pickup.\n\nNeeded to contact someone? Call them, have an actual conversation. No hiding behind text.\n\nEvery single thing became harder and that was the point. Build back the ability to handle difficulty.\n\nWeek 1 I almost quit immediately\n\nFirst week was brutal. My brain was used to having everything instantly and easily. Now everything required effort and discomfort.\n\nDay 1 I wanted lunch. Normally I\u2019d order it. Now I had to either cook or walk 15 minutes to get something. Felt exhausting just thinking about it. Almost gave up and ordered anyway but the apps were deleted.\n\nWalked to get food. Felt annoyed and uncomfortable the whole time. Got back and realized I\u2019d just done something that used to feel impossible.\n\nDay 3 took my first cold shower. Stood there dreading it for five minutes. Finally did it. Lasted maybe 20 seconds before I gave up. Felt like I\u2019d accomplished something just for trying.\n\nDay 5 had to take the bus somewhere. Hadn\u2019t used public transit in over a year. Felt anxious and out of place. Did it anyway because driving wasn\u2019t an option.\n\nDay 7 I sat in my apartment at night with nothing to do. No streaming services to watch. No easy entertainment. Just boredom. It was uncomfortable. Ended up reading a book because there was nothing else.\n\nWeek one sucked but I didn\u2019t quit. Every discomfort I pushed through proved I was stronger than I thought.\n\nWeek 2 to 3 discomfort became manageable\n\nWeeks two and three the daily challenges continued but started feeling less impossible.\n\nCold showers went from 20 seconds to a full minute. Still hated them but I could handle it. Walking everywhere stopped feeling like a burden and just became normal.\n\nDay 10 I talked to someone in line at the coffee shop. Felt awkward but I did it. Small conversation about nothing. Before this I would\u2019ve avoided any interaction.\n\nDay 15 the plan increased the challenges. Week three required working out six days instead of four. Required cooking all meals instead of allowing some takeout. Required one genuinely uncomfortable social interaction daily.\n\nDay 18 I went to a climbing gym alone knowing nobody. Felt terrified walking in. Did it anyway. Left feeling proud for facing something that scared me.\n\nWeek three I cooked every single meal. No exceptions. Went grocery shopping twice, walked both times carrying bags. My legs got stronger, my discipline got stronger.\n\nDay 21 I realized I hadn\u2019t watched any streaming content in three weeks. Hadn\u2019t ordered food in three weeks. Hadn\u2019t taken the easy path once. I was doing things I would\u2019ve said were impossible a month ago.\n\nWeek 4 to 6 I started seeking discomfort\n\nWeeks four through six something shifted. I stopped dreading the discomfort and started wanting it.\n\nCold showers became something I looked forward to. Proof every morning that I could do hard things. Walking everywhere meant I was outside, moving, present instead of isolated in my car.\n\nDay 28 I did a full two minute cold shower without wanting to quit. A month ago twenty seconds felt unbearable.\n\nWeek five challenges increased again. Required taking the harder path even when easier options existed. Required seeking out uncomfortable situations instead of just not avoiding them.\n\nDay 35 I went to a social meetup for something I was interested in. Went alone. Talked to people I didn\u2019t know. Would\u2019ve been impossible two months ago. Now it was just another challenge to face.\n\nI was cooking elaborate meals because cooking became meditative. Was walking over an hour daily because it gave me time to think. Working out became non negotiable because it was proof I had discipline.\n\nDay 40 I looked back at week one when walking fifteen minutes for food felt exhausting. Now I\u2019d walk an hour without thinking about it. My capacity for discomfort had expanded completely.\n\nWeek 7 to 8 complete transformation\n\nLast two weeks I was unrecognizable from who I started as.\n\nCold showers were easy. Three minutes of cold water felt like nothing. I was actively seeking harder challenges because easy ones weren\u2019t enough anymore.\n\nDay 50 I did something that terrified me. Went to an open mic and told a story in front of strangers. Bombed completely. Didn\u2019t care. Did the thing that scared me and survived.\n\nWeek eight challenges were the hardest. Fasting for 24 hours. Having difficult conversations I\u2019d been avoiding. Doing things that made me genuinely uncomfortable. I did all of them.\n\nI\u2019d walked over 200 miles total during the 60 days. Cooked every single meal. Took cold showers every morning. Faced dozens of uncomfortable situations. Built discipline I didn\u2019t know I was capable of.\n\nDay 60 I sat in my apartment and realized I was a completely different person. Two months ago the smallest discomfort felt unbearable. Now I could handle almost anything.\n\nWhat actually changed in 60 days\n\nI built real discipline\n\nWent from unable to handle any discomfort to actively seeking it out. My capacity for doing hard things expanded completely.\n\nMy mental resilience transformed\n\nSmall inconveniences that used to ruin my day became nothing. I could handle setbacks and difficulty without falling apart.\n\nMy physical health improved dramatically\n\nLost 18 pounds from walking everywhere and working out consistently. Got visibly stronger. Had energy I hadn\u2019t felt in years.\n\nI stopped being controlled by comfort\n\nUsed to organize my entire life around avoiding discomfort. Now discomfort was just part of life and I could handle it.\n\nI proved I was capable of way more than I thought\n\nSpent years thinking I was just weak. Turns out I\u2019d made myself weak by removing all challenge from my life.\n\nI became present in my life\n\nWalking everywhere meant I was outside experiencing the world. Cooking meant I was engaged in the process. No more hiding behind screens and delivery apps.\n\nWhat I learned about comfort\n\nComfort is a trap. Feels good short term but destroys you long term.\n\nThe more you optimize for comfort the less capable you become of handling difficulty. Your capacity for discomfort shrinks until everything feels hard.\n\nModern life makes it easy to remove all friction. That ease destroys discipline, resilience, growth, everything that makes you strong.\n\nYou need regular discomfort to maintain your ability to handle life. Without it you become fragile and weak.\n\nSeeking discomfort sounds terrible but it\u2019s the only way to build real strength. Not just physical, mental and emotional strength.\n\nIf you\u2019ve made your life too comfortable\n\nLook at where you\u2019ve optimized everything for ease. Food delivery, endless entertainment, avoiding all inconvenience. Those comforts are making you weak.\n\nRemove one major convenience for one week. Delete food delivery apps and cook or walk to get food. See how it feels to add friction back.\n\nAdd one daily discomfort. Cold showers, working out when you don\u2019t feel like it, having conversations that feel awkward. Build the habit of doing hard things.\n\nUse tools that enforce it. I used Reload to block all the easy paths and build a progressive plan of increasing challenges. Made backsliding impossible.\n\nStart small but increase weekly. Week one discomforts should be manageable. Week eight discomforts should genuinely challenge you.\n\nTrack your capacity growing. Notice how things that felt impossible become easy. How your threshold for difficulty expands.\n\nGive it 60 days minimum. First two weeks suck. Week four you start adapting. Week eight you\u2019re unrecognizable.\n\nFinal thought\n\nTwo months ago I was completely soft. Optimized my entire life for comfort and convenience and became weak and miserable.\n\nNow I\u2019m strong. Physically, mentally, emotionally. Can handle discomfort without falling apart. Seek challenges instead of avoiding them.\n\nThe difference was removing every comfort and forcing myself to face difficulty daily until I became capable again.\n\nYou\u2019re probably too comfortable. Your life is probably too easy. That ease is destroying you slowly.\n\nRemove the comforts. Add friction. Do hard things daily. Build back your strength.\n\nThe version of you that faces discomfort is infinitely stronger than the version that hides from it.\n\nStart today.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b",

I have used methylfenidate some time ago (also when experiencing burnout) and it made me super apathetic, brain fog and tired. I\u2019m also taking 100mg sertraline for anxiety.  \n\nSince 3 days I started taking dexamphetamine and im experiencing almost the same effects unfortunately. It seems expected and normal to have a stimulating effect like feeling more awake, more focused, more motivation and at the same time a calmer mind. But my head feels like it\u2019s fysically full and i cant function because of the brain fog and apathy. \n\nNow my question is: because im burnout out and have ADHD, does the dexamphetamine finally let my body get some rest and i feel how exhausted i actually am and should i give in to the fatigue? \n\nOr does the dexamphetamine actually overload my already exhausted nervous system and is making my burnout worse? \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nI find it scary that dexamphetamine which should make me more awake, alert and focused is making me even more exhausted and apathetic instead. I really like to hear your experiences! If you are already really exhausted, does dex make you more exhausted? Or does it always serve as a upper to make you more awake. ",

For example, instead of feeling normal anger in response to an unjust situation, I sometimes feel an extremely intense anger that consumes me for 5 minutes. I would rant my head off to the people around me. But then when that anger dissipates after those 5 minutes, I don\u2019t get why I was angry in the first place. This could apply to other emotions too like curiosity, excitement, sadness, etc.\n\nI tend to feel extremely shameful after these emotional hyperfixations especially with anger. After being calmer, I just don\u2019t get how I got to that very irrational emotional state and would hate/blame myself over it.

I would feel so guilty for feeling such intense anger at all.\n\nI wanted to ask if anyone else can relate and give advice? Or if anyone knows any research or guides related to this?

I don't know what the fear of initiating is about.\n\nI think he has RSD. If I try to talk to him about his terrible communication or possible ADHD, he looks like he's bracing for a blow. When we hang out, sometimes he's his goofy self, other times he's anxious, as if he's waiting for me to break up with him or tell him off. \n\nOutside of this, he works, his home is clean and organized, and he has a routine. His masking is better than mine. You'd never think he might have ADHD. He isn't medicated and he doesn't want therapy. \n\nA part of me wants to walk away, but the other part wants me to give him the grace, understanding, patience, and kindness I wish people would show me with my crippling anxiety, social ineptitude and struggle to communicate.\n\nSo guys, any advice on how to navigate this or if I should?

Now i'm exhausted because i go to bed very late and then wake up early for working.... i don't manage to control myself despite alarm to go to bed, melatonine or whatever i try to manage, i'm super active and can't stop to do things at home until super late in the night \n\nHas anyone experienced the same problem and found any solutions?\n\nI believe some of you use supplements or split or use a diluted doses. I\u2019m really looking for advice because I\u2019m now exhausted from the lack of sleep. \n\nMy psychiatrist suggested going back to Ritalin, but I\u2019d like to try to find a balance since everything else is better \u2014 although in its current state, it\u2019s not sustainable.\n\nThanks in advance for your feedback. \ud83d\ude4f",

I wasnt able to do that for almost month, but then i tried to sleep earlier on my free day and *zap* next day i woke up like Sonic, jumped out of bed, everything was nice, hyperfocused for 2,5h on recording, nothing else existed, and than i realised how rude im to myself, when i push my sleep, how i forget my whole \u201ctake yourself as another person\u201d thingie.\n\n\nAnd that works for more things, not just sleep and productivity in this specific way. Try it on your free day, stop pushing yourself in things you \u201cShOuLd\u201d because sucessful people do it, and do things as you feel, now you maybe question it, but it makes life actually so much better \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",

I take it for a few days, then take a few days off so I don't develop a tolerance. \n\nI do feel some euphoria in the first hour after taking my Vyvanse. Like I feel good, very positive about my outlook on life, and somewhat unrealistic about how much I can get done in the day ahead.\n\nThere are also several times throughout the day where I feel a sense of dread, like I'm anxious about when the meds wear off. I don't want to go back to being myself, where I struggle to hold conversations and get things done. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this? I can't talk to my provider about it, as I'm afraid he will discontinue the meds that are literally helping me function. I'm also wondering if there are people with ADHD who have these reactions. TIA! ",

Why isn\u2019t this moment good enough, why am I not connecting to deeper level with that person, why is this class too boring for me. My brain scans nonstop. It\u2019s exhausting, but it also does not handle boredom. \n\nIm not even an adrenaline junky as we could say about someone who like extreme sports, or take some substance, have lots of risky behavior. \n\nBecause:\n\n\\- If things are too boring \u2192 I feel under-stimulated, flat, disconnected.\n\n\\- If things are too much \u2192 I feel overwhelmed and burnt out so fast.\n\nAnd the tricky part is: I struggle to genuinely enjoy things that aren\u2019t at least a little \u201cwow.\u201d Calm often doesn\u2019t feel peaceful, it feels like nothing. Which means that getting in a romantic relationship is terrible, because I\u2019ll idealize you and then at every moment we\u2019ll spend together I\u2019ll have the highest expectation: why aren\u2019t we having more fun ? Why don\u2019t I love them and feel it buzzing all over my body ? Why don\u2019t I miss them all the time ? \n\nAnd I end up in abusive relationship because the highs and lows keep me on my toes.\n\nI just feel like my brain needs a certain level of activation to register something as meaningful. But nothing has been feeling meaningful enough so I ruminate more and more on these kind of stuffs. I\u2019m on a low dose of Medikinet but I feel like it doesn\u2019t change anything about this feeling. \n\nIf someone is / has been in a similar situation, please give me advices ? ",

Before the appointment, I filled out a detailed questionnaire. A family member completed a form about my childhood, and a friend filled one out about how I am now.\n\nThe actual appointment was about 60\u201390 minutes over the phone. The nurse practitioner was very kind and thorough. After reviewing everything, she diagnosed me with ADHD (predominantly inattentive) and prescribed two medications to trial:\n\n\\- Dexedrine Spansules 10 mg\n\n\\- Methylphenidate SR 20 mg\n\nThe plan is to try one medication for two weeks, then the other for two weeks, track my symptoms, and follow up to choose the best one and adjust the dose.\n\nI also paid about $80 for an assessment summary report, which includes the formal diagnosis. If I want a letter of accommodation for my university\u2019s Centre for Accessibility, that\u2019s another $150 (which I\u2019m considering because extra time on exams would honestly help \u2014 I\u2019m just worried about timing with finals).\n\nThe whole thing feels kind of unreal. I picked up my prescription today and took my first dose. I\u2019ve seen so many videos of people saying they felt an immediate difference when they started medication, but I didn\u2019t really notice anything. That was a bit disappointing, even though I know starting doses are low and meds aren\u2019t magic.\n\nFor anyone who has:\n\n\\- Gone through online ADHD diagnosis \u2014 what was your experience like?\n\n\\- Had an adult ADHD diagnosis \u2014 did it feel fast to you?\n\n\\- Started stimulant medication \u2014 what did it feel like at the beginning?\n\nI think I\u2019m just trying to figure out if this all sounds normal or if anyone else felt this weird \u201cis this real?\u201d feeling.

I put up with it hoping it would get better, but I couldn't take it after 2 weeks and asked to be put on a lower dose. \n\nNow I'm on 5mg IR two times a day and it's been two days. Yesterday wasn't too bad but today it's back and even worse than before. \n\nI can't spend the rest of my life like this. I haven't had a solid poop in 3 weeks, my stomach hurts and churns all the time. I have to stay near a bathroom, I can't go out and do stuff. Stomach meds aren't helping. I want to cry. There's no point in being medicated if I have to stay within 1 minute of a toilet at all times. I literally have about 90 seconds warning or else I'll crap myself. I'm not lactose intolerant nor do I have IBS and it's not regular so I can't schedule being near a bathroom.\n\nAnd I can't even tell if the meds are seriously helping. (I can tell when they kick in but concentration is still a hit and miss) In fact I actually think I need a little higher dose, but I don't want a higher dose because I assume more means even worse diarrhea.  I've searched this reddit for information and found people suffering but no real answers, just people shrugging and never posting again. Or they only have a little diarrhea, not 3-8 times a day which is where I'm at right now. \n\nI was so hopeful that meds would be my answer but now I'm already considering quitting. My doctor told me to try 2 weeks of IR but what do I do if I still have this after a month on medication? Do all ADHD stimulant meds cause this? Thanks.",

This time I drank tons of water and no caffeine. Well it happened again this time on my left side of my body, and this time took me A LOT longer to recover. My left arm was numb for almost 2 months, forearm was in extreme pain, eye twitches. I really thought i messed up my body and did some nerve damage or something. \n\n  \nI talked to my doctor and she brushed it off, didn't think it was the medicine and told me my blood work and nerves are fine. I did always do a lot of nicotine and drink caffeine everytime I have taken adderall since I started. I have now realized thats probably not a good idea. \n\nI decided to take a long break, it's been 3 months now with no adderall and no caffeine. I am also 1 month nicotine free. I finally feel normal again so I was wondering if I should start again but in really small doses???? obviously this time with no nicotine or caffeine ever again. My doctor just said to not take a break and I was fine but I don't know.\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "So I just took like 4 hours of adhd testing and I don\u2019t know how to feel. It started with me copying down a picture and doing questionnaires. They interrupted me to redraw the image from memory and I felt pretty good about it. I did those block puzzles where you try to recreate the image and I do pretty good, I said the definitions of words and did other iq test things and I felt pretty good about those too. I also did really well on recalling numbers she said and saying the last 5 or 6 back to her. I also did a vr test thing in an aquarium where I had to follow instructions on when to press a button based on what fish passed by and what the narrator was saying. Oh also there was this weird card sorting game that I swear switched the rules on my ever 5 seconds.\n\nThe thing is I\u2019ve always been a good tester and besides the aquarium game near the end I felt I did really good, making me fear that my testing skills will cause me to get an incorrect negative diagnosis. Anyone here been in a similar situation?I\u2019ve always gotten good grades and been good at tests despite my problems studying, focusing, and remembering and I just want accurate results.",

My brother proposed that this happens to him when he's **bored/not being sufficiently stimulated**. At first I was skeptical because I myself have sleep issues and it's hard to separate the daytime lethargy from the fact that I often just didn't manage to sleep properly. But I slowly started noticing a reproducible pattern of: I feel fine, I go to my very boring and stressful \"job\", I immediately start feeling REALLY sleepy. I get home looking forward to finally getting some sleep, but as soon as I'm at home and able to do stuff I'm interested in, I'm suddenly totally awake. It could be that I'm just getting my second wind, but I've also noticed that when I'm doing some boring work at home, I will go from \"I got 9h of sleep and feel amazing\" to \"omg I can't keep my eyes open\" in seconds. Then I'll be awake again as soon as I'm interested in something. So I'm starting to think there's something to it.\n\n**I read an older** [**post** ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1qjz5ip/how_many_of_us_are_perpetually_exhausted/)**about this topic here where OP says drinking alcohol and exercise are the only things that kinda help them wake up** and that rings really true for my both my brother and me. Drinking is obviously not the best coping mechanism so I've slowly started picking up more exercise and it's the only thing that kinda helps, but it's not always feasible + sometimes when I exercise TOO hard it actually makes me really sleepy. \n\n**Do you guys experience the lethargy and what are some coping mechanisms that work for you?**\n\n",

Like either the quota need to be increased for medication production from the already too low cap, or it\u2019s just going to keep getting harder and worse to get meds from everyone getting diagnosed all the time? \nIt\u2019s like one of those things where demand keeps going up and supply is UNABLE to keep up and my brain is flagging this as \u201cthis isn\u2019t sustainable\u201d and I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna happen as the years go on and I\u2019m like worried like omg do I need to quit now before i basically lose all access? Ya know",

In 2019, I underwent a psycho-educational assessment for university, which required someone close to me to fill out a questionnaire. At that time, my only close relationship was with my ex-boyfriend, and ultimately, I was diagnosed with a learning disability but not ADHD.\n\nLately, I've been struggling to manage school, work, and personal issues. I often have \"crashing out days\" when I feel overwhelmed and can't focus. Today is one of those days, prompting me to consider seeking a diagnosis and treatment.\n\nI'm in Ontario, Canada, and I heard that ADHD assessments can be covered by OHIP if referred by a primary care physician. However, the process can take months, and I need help immediately. I found Frida, a program that offers a diagnosis in days for $599, but I qualify for a discount and can get the initial assessment for $299. The catch is that follow-up appointments are $99 for discussing medication refills and treatment plans.\n\nHas anyone used this service? Is it worth it? I'm wondering if I could get diagnosed through them, then discuss the diagnosis with my regular doctor to receive medication without continually paying $99 for appointments. I believe I have some attention deficit disorder, and I want an official diagnosis to validate my struggles. Thanks for listening to my crash out!",

My mom's asked me if i feel more tired, more anxious, if I've had trouble sleeping, etc. And... I don't know?

It felt like my brain clicked off and I was forced to cut back on the amount of hours I work tremendously. I've done a lot of mental work to change my mindsets and bring myself out of the depression, but my ADHD is worse than ever. I have absolutely no drive, no will power, no follow-through, no zest for life, and I feel like everything around me is just a train wreck. I'm only able to hold down a job because I'm self-employed, but there are a lot of days where I'll go to a meeting or answer a couple emails and phone calls, but the rest of the day I can't pry myself off the couch. I sit down at the computer and I can't force myself to work anywhere close to what I use to. I'm overwhelmed by all of the undone things around me that keep me from being able to make any sort of traction. My IQ is 130-140 and my brain can tell me that in order to do this, you need to do A, B, C, etc. but when it comes to doing those things I completely suck. Two different psychiatrist put me on every medicine under the solun and nothing fixed my depression because it was more than a brain chemistry thing. I had to work through a lot of issues (millions of self-help books and counselors). Right now the thought of doing any more talking just feels pointless. Honestly, it all feels pointless. My brain has told me I should kill myself more days of my life than not, but I keep going for my kids. I'm not going to hurt myself but I have no joy or reason to keep going and I've been in this rut so long that I've run out of hope that things will ever get better. \n\nSo what have you done that actually works???",

I reorganized my task manager. I watched productivity videos.  \nI told myself I\u2019d do it later.\n\nThe problem wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t know what to do. The problem was the invisible wall between thinking about it and starting it. If you have ADHD, you probably know this. The bigger the task is like taxes, job applications, admin work the thicker the wall gets.\n\nI realized something uncomfortable. Most tools help you manage tasks. They don\u2019t help start. So, instead of writing tasks like Fix my finances. I forced the system to shrink it aggressively.\n\nI mean brutally small.\n\nStep 1: Open your banking app.  \nStep 2: Screenshot your current balance.  \nStep 3: Write down the number.\n\nWhen the first step was small enough, my brain didn\u2019t resist it.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t scary anymore.

I don\u2019t struggle with productivity. I struggle with activation. The distance between 0 and 1. So, me and my friends built a [starting tool](https://app.healup.me?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=ADHD) (it's free) to solve overwhelm.\n\nYou type the heavy thing exactly as it feels in your head. File my overdue taxes, apply for 2nd income job, settle my credit card debts and etc. And instead of giving you a long explanation or strategy, it immediately shrinks it into entry-level steps.\n\nSteps that are small enough to start even when you stuck. You can regenerate them if they still feel too big. You can go deeper if you need structure. \n\nMake the first move so small that resistance has nothing to grab onto. Not to promo but just genuinely want help people do things easier.\n\nThe hardest part was never finishing. It was beginning.",

    "selftext": "I\u2019m struggling with a very specific problem in habit change: remembering to do the small replacement behaviors I\u2019ve already planned, at the exact moment they\u2019re supposed to interrupt an old habit.\n\nFor context, I\u2019m actively trying to replace existing behaviors with healthier ones to become more efficient, productive, and physically healthier. A concrete example:\n\n\t1. I have a long-standing smoking habit.\n\n\t2. The triggers are predictable: finishing a task or sub-task, feeling stuck on a complex problem, or needing a mental reset.\n\n\t3. Smoking serves as a \u201creset ritual\u201d that helps me recalibrate and plan next steps.\n\nI\u2019ve identified a replacement behavior (pushups, squats, skipping), and when I remember to do it, I can resist smoking for that instance, putting some \u201ctime distance\u201d between the previous and the next cigarette.\n\nThe core issue is this: I don\u2019t remember to do the replacement behavior in the moment.\n\nI\u2019ve tried:\n\n\t1. Visual prompts (posters in my line of sight like \u201c10 pushups now\u201d)\n\n\t2. Alarms and reminders with explicit instructions\n\n3. creating \u201caction Phrase passwords\u201d to remind me of what needs doing everytime I have to login somewhere. \n\nBut when I\u2019m deeply focused on work, I either stop noticing the posters or instinctively dismiss the alarms without acting.\n\nWhat\u2019s confusing is that I have made progress elsewhere, which tells me I\u2019m not failing at habit change in general:\n\n\t1. Quit Instagram completely (2 months clean)\n\n\t2. Reduced daily screen time from \\\\\\~7 hours to \\\\\\~4 hours(primarily LinkedIn or other job portals since I am actively looking for a job change, but pickup times have reduced to less than 20 times a day)\n\n\t3. Back to the gym 3\u00d7 a week (with empathetic and consistent accountability partners, that I was fortunate enough to find in my immediate circle)\n\n\t4. Improved meal timing and reduced mindless eating\n\n\t5. Built consistency with daily household tasks (still imperfect, but improving, with the extreme love and solid support of my wife)\n\n\t6. Overall functioning is \\\\\\~70\u201375% better than late last year\n\nSo I\u2019m clearly capable and blessed with solid support and enablement of building habits when structure or accountability exists.\n\nWhat I keep struggling with is this \u201ctemporary amnesia\u201d around the small, in-the-moment actions that are meant to override an automatic behavior.\n\nSome Additional context, since I see these follow-up questions being asked:\n\n\t1. ADHD (combined type), on daily medication\n\n\t2. History of clinical MDD (- this is also the source of my executive dysfunction , diagnosed \\\\\\~5 years ago; treated with meds + therapy; off antidepressants for 2 years)\n\nMy Questions\n\nSo, those who\u2019ve faced similar challenges:\n\n\t1. How do you reliably remember to execute a planned micro-habit in the moment, especially during deep focus?\n\n\t2. What strategies helped you bridge the gap between intention and automatic action?\n\n\t3. Are there tactics beyond reminders and visual cues that actually worked for you?\n\nI\u2019m looking for mechanisms.Any practical strategies, frameworks, or lived experiences would be greatly appreciated.",

After today\u2019s appointment he said that I have some signs of ADHD, but it could also be anxiety which I\u2019m on Zoloft for. I\u2019m pretty sure that Kaiser doesn\u2019t think that I have ADHD even though I have the paperwork to prove that I have the diagnosis. Anyway if you made it this far, thank you for reading this. I really just needed to vent.",

Insurance refers to this policy as 'Try/Fail' trials, wherein my doctor and I make absolute sure that Vyvanse is the right stimulant for me. I\u2019ve had very few side effects from Vyvanse, so it just wasn't necessary to trial other medications. I haven't even built a tolerance to Vyvanse, and I've been on 70mg for almost three years. So you can imagine how frustrating this is. \n\nI am interested to find out if my back muscle stiffness is a symptom of Vyvanse or if it's entirely related to my hyper-mobility issues. So far I've managed that symptom with stretches and exercise. \n\nI\u2019m just really nervous. Switching meds in the middle of my semester (in grad school mind you) while applying to jobs sounds very risky, from my current perspective. \n\nI would love to hear others' experiences about switching from Vyvanse to Concerta\u2014high dosage. Either generic or name brand anecdotes are fine.  ",

Somehow I managed to avoid taking the medication for long periods and managed to graduate from Comp Sci and have a stable tech job without it.\n\nDespite this i still live my life as a maximally put low effort into everything. If it wasn't social pressure I definitely wouldn't be able to keep my job.\n\nI recently started injesting pure Amphetamine and found it really engaging for the first time. I felt like I was clearly headed and not so lazy with my thinking. I was taking concerta before and that was good for focus but killed my emotions but Amphetamine didnt.\n\nAnyway I was wondering what medication is the closest to pure Amphetamine?\n\nEDIT: my doctor just prescribed me Vyvanse even tho I asked for adderall.

I take 150% the max allowable does and the situation is kind of dire.\n- 8 months ago, I was officially diagnosed with ADHD.\n- 2 weeks ago I started Ritalin in combination with the SSRI \n- I have strong mood and behavioral outbursts.\n- social anxiety is also a big issue.\n- I do hold a PhD in STEM and hold a full time job as a scientist \n- financially, I have given almost 50% of my salary to family and spouse for the last 15 years. So I financially drained myself and have no savings, yet live an very frugal life.\n\nI wrote all of the introduction to give a whollistic idea of my situation.\n\nWhat bothers me the most are the outbursts. These outbursts come out of control and sometimes for minute reasons. I tried controlling myself, but I found the best option is to fully isolate myself.\n\nNo matter what I do, I always feel that I am under performing. At work, at home, with family and spouse... This makes me super stressed and obsessive. Hence ruining most of my time, and especially sleep.\n\nThe obsessive thoughts are overwhelming such that I cannot spend alone time without getting angry. So I occupy myself with work and social media. Else I will be obsessing and getting worked up.\n\nAfter taking Ritalin, all these annoying behaviors have amplified.\n\nAll in all, I am very lucky and relatively successful in life. Compering to others, I should be content with my life.\n\nMy questions to you:\n- have you had SSRI with Ritalin?\n- did you experience similar behavior with Ritalin?\n- how do you deal with depression and ADHD?",

I have picked it up during \"safe\" times and quit (repeatedly).\n\nI went through IVF (2025) and miscarried the only embryo I had (10/2025). After testing without answers, I blamed the MC on my weight.  I decided to do VSG surgery to reduce my weight. VSG is the reason for my waiting period.\n\n  \nDue to the surgery, I can't \"try naturally\" until 6/2026 or do IVF until 12/2026. My tubes are 100%L/80%R blocked so I'm not optimistic. \n\n  \nTo really complicate matters, I'm adopted and my biological sister got pregnant at the same time I did. We had the same due date in May/26. She is leaning heavy towards adoption and I offered to be an option for her. I've always been open to adoption. See my comment about the details of the situation. IVF will happen regardless of the adoption, I've want more than one kid. \n\n  \nGoing through IVF I could schedule and plan out medications &amp; appts. It kept my mind busy and optimistic. Same with my VSG surgery. Now I have nothing to channel my energy into and I feel stuck. Like my gas pedal is to the floor, the car is in neutral, the RPMs are in the red, and the engine it HOT. This feeling has me craving old coping mechanisms that I've worked so hard to stop. \n\nIf you have had a similar season of waiting, please share the way you coped with not being able to control your timeline.   \n",

    "selftext": "My best friend has ADHD and often feels like his day just disappears. To help him and myself see where the time goes, I am building a simple tool called **Tally It Down** (MVP phase now).\n\n**The Method**\n\nWe use a practice called **Event Tracking** to make invisible time feel real. When you finish a task or even just drink water, you \"Tally\" it down. This provides physical proof that your day actually happened. It helps ground your brain when you feel like you have accomplished nothing.\n\n**The Tool**\n\nI am keeping this as simple as possible to avoid any stress. The most important rule is that there are no streaks. **Broken streaks often lead to shame**, so this tool focuses on your total progress instead. It only takes one tap to record an event so you can get back to your life immediately.\n\n**The Alternative Methods**\n\nYou do not need an app to start this. A mechanical tally counter or a simple piece of paper on your desk works just as well. Some people move marbles from one jar to another to see their wins grow physically. However, this may cause higher friction, which is harmful to construct a stable recording habits. \n\nIn summary, I am building this to be a support system for my friend and anyone else who feels lost in their own memory. Tracking should feel like a relief rather than a burden. \n\nThank you all and wish you all the best!",

    "selftext": "So I'm about 6 hrs away from one month cold turkey on nicotine. I had gotten sick with a cold and cough that laid me out for a few days so I just surrendered and quit. I had been self medicating with nicotine since I was 12 (almost 50 now) and have been getting real medication since June last year. Before I quit smoking  I felt like I had a bit of balance, but I was smoking more and more, I had to stop it because the fear was intolerable. \n\nThis has been a strange trip for me. I probably ruined a relationship with a coworker. The medication hit so much differently after day 3 I felt nuts. and I remained in a hyper responsive state for almost 3 weeks due to the lost interaction, inaccessibility to a doctor and increased symptoms. Medication came on stronger and faster and died crashed quicker. On reflection, this was further exacerbated by not completely quitting coffee. \n\nOn the positive, between the Allen Carr book and the medication, it was easier to distinguish the physical addiction from the psychological. Even though its been rough, I feel much better physically, and about one month in, my brain is making some feel goods again. Nevertheless I'm still keeping myself fairly isolated until feel 100% all day, which I am hopeful for, every day is feeling better now. \n\nThree things I would do differently: stop the caffeine first (it becomes a completely different thing), and book a doctor appointment ahead of time so if you need an adjustment you aren't left without support. Finally even if you prepare your co-workers, limit your interactions as much as you can. There is no sense in losing face, and non-addicts, as much as they may try,  will probably never understand what you are going through. \n\nHope this helps someone:)",

Work felt impossible, and I just needed to breathe. But now, after a month at home, the guilt is crushing me. Having to rely on my dad for money and minor installments makes me feel like a total burden, and I\u2019m worried this will lead to deep depression.\n\nMy doctor suggested medication, but I\u2019m terrified of side effects and dependency, so we\u2019re starting with CBT (Therapy) for now.\n\nMy questions here:\n\n1. Has anyone successfully managed ADHD through therapy alone, or is medication necessary to function at work?\n2. Does the \"burnout\" ever go away, or will I just fall into the same cycle if I start a business or a new job?\n3. How do you handle the guilt of being \"unproductive\" while trying to recover?",

This is so freaking unhealthy to just cold turkey withdrawal from stimulant medications repeatedly especially when I have other struggles as well like depression and anxiety. I don't understand why they do this when it wreaks havoc on the brain to go from being able to get stuff done to crashing and slipping right back down to being unproductive. Like if you don't have enough, don't prescribe it?? That BS isn't done with anti depressants... I mean this could be solved if every 3 year old that was a little hyper wasn't prescribed this stuff, or every teenager going through their \"rawr XD\" phase wasnt just diagnosed with ADHD. Im almost certain not everybody diagnosed with ADHD has it to where there's a nationwide shortage. No way. Especially now when social media is known to be causing low attention spans. Medication shouldn't be prescribed, lower screen time is the fix to that. If the issue persists, then it may be ADHD. Over prescribing is genuinely harming those who need the medication. If everybody who was prescribed it actually needed it, it wouldn't be sold recreationally the way it is. At this point I'm ready to tell my prescribe \"screw it\" and get off of it. Because it works so well for me but it's a bigger problem when I have to just stop it. Im so done with this. ",

I've gotten to the point I will refuse to do anything else until I am 'on time'. For work, I wake up an hour or two earlier than I need and set off so early I am usually there nearly 30mins early. If I have a table booked, I will start showering and putting on makeup 3hrs before I need to leave.

It makes it so I can't even do anything before another \"appointment\" in the day.\n\nMy extra stress is now I'm comfortable with work, I tried being \"\"normal\"\" and go on time. I ended up 10mins late. Since I've made myself 'reliable', I think it is now noticed MORE than other coworkers being late!!! **So the pressure is even higher now.** If ever I try to relax and do life the 'normal' way, I end up late to work or the cinema or a restaurant etc. Then it reinforces panic for the next few outings.\n\nI got diagnosed on Monday with ADHD-PI, so I am hoping that this issue is resolved once therapy/meds start in 10\\~months.

    "selftext": "TL;DR - tried and tested tips for ADHD and non-adhd parents to help their ADHD kids be more self sufficient and independent. Because let's be real - we all would prefer someone else do all the boring stuff for us, but that's not reality, and that's not the son I want to raise. \n\nI saw a similar post in a parenting subreddit I'm in, and ended up feeling really off from the mass of answers. \n\nA dad of a 5 year old was asking what age people started teaching their kids how to do things for themselves. SO MANY of their answers talked about how helpful their kids have been since they could walk. Their 3 year old pours her own water. Their 5 year old does dishes. Their kid became so helpful from 2 to 4 years old. \n\nMeanwhile, I'm over here remembering the ages of 2-4 with terror and relief it's over, and thinking about how my almost-9 year old will ask me to get his school bag for him when he's a foot away and I'm in another room. And how if I point out he's closer, he'll get up, come into the room and cross to the other side of me so that I'M closer, because at that point, the game is WAY more fun than doing the thing he already doesn't want to do. \n\nBut also, I get it, because I had ADHD too, and I fully understand both his side and my side of the interaction, because I've lived both. \n\nSo what ADHD friendly ways have you successfully used to build independence in your kids? Especially if you're in a mixed household. My husband doesn't have ADHD, and will just do stuff when he's asked without even thinking about it half the time. But now he's basically taught our son that he can be interrupted and inconvenienced anytime.",

Later in high school I tried guanfacine, but it left me feeling emotionally flat, so I stopped.\n\nIn college I began noticing strong mood swings, especially after a difficult fallout in a friendship. Talking openly with my prescriber shifted the focus toward mood regulation. I tried a few medications that didn\u2019t work well for me, which was discouraging, but eventually I started lamotrigine. With time and gradual adjustment, it felt like something finally clicked. I felt more present, less detached, and more able to engage with my life. Adding extended-release Concerta later on helped me feel more capable of following through on goals.\n\nI\u2019m sharing this because finding the right approach can take time and a lot of communication with providers. For me, noticing mood patterns was an important piece that I hadn\u2019t fully recognized before. Everyone\u2019s experience is different, but if you feel stuck, continuing to track patterns and talk with your care team can make a difference. I feel more steady now and better able to show up in relationships and everyday life.",

For 28 years, I knew there was some sh\\*t messed up with me, but rather than thinking it could be at a clinical level, I just lived my life with a fatalistic approach, thinking maybe it was just the way I was built (I've been a materialist atheist since I was 15, lol). However, ever since I got diagnosed and started medication and therapy, I've become aware of certain things.\n\nI now know that I am neither lazy nor stupid. I've seen that when I am functional, I exhibit high-level intelligence and performance.\n\nHowever, I don't know how to cope with RSD (Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria), another issue I discovered a little less than a year ago. Therapy only takes me so far. I feel that by talking to other people suffering from the same issue\u2014the very thing that triggers my constant failures and getting fired in my work life\u2014and learning how they cope with it, I might be able to incorporate their methods into my own life.\n\nHow do you guys deal with your rejection sensitivity? While scrambling to meet a hypothetical deadline I gave due to my time blindness, I can only muster the courage to tell my employer that I won't be able to finish the work right when the deadline actually hits. I'm scared. If I could just overcome this fear and face it, I know I'd be able to prevent a lot of bad things from happening, but I just can't do it.\n\nWhat are your experiences regarding this issue?",

Surprisingly, I\u2019ve always done well on tests and other fast, structured tasks, but I\u2019ve struggled with essays, projects, and presentations since high school. I think it\u2019s because tests are very structured, and I\u2019ve always been able to learn things quickly, whereas open-ended tasks leave me feeling stuck.\n\nI chose a design program because I wanted to follow my interests, not just what I was naturally good at. I\u2019ve always been artistic and creative, but anything requiring a large breadth of information, flexibility, and organization has been hard for me. I often start ideas and then abandon them, and I feel lost. Research works better when I\u2019m absolutely certain about the topic, but otherwise there\u2019s friction between me and the task. I feel like I should really take the time to go deep into a topic rather than forgetting it and moving onto to something else. Even deadlines rarely motivate me until the last minute or external pressure pushes me.\n\nI\u2019m often creative, but stress seems to block my flow. I work best when instructions are clear or when I\u2019m passionate and know what I want from the start. I\u2019m learning to sit with my emotions and see assignments as explorations, but this issue has persisted since first year. I have GAD, and doctors weren\u2019t sure about ADHD. I also struggle with perfectionism, which I know is tied to childhood experiences of feeling rejected or isolated when I wasn\u2019t \u201cperfect,\u201d and attaching my self-worth to accomplishments.\n\nWhen I get into these ruts, I stop feeling present and often feel burnt out. I\u2019m trying to be more compassionate with myself, remind myself that each assignment is temporary, and work on breaking this cycle of shame. I'm embarassed to work with my classmates sometimes because I ultimately feel so behind.",

    "selftext": "One of the biggest ADHD-related things that bothers me is my apparent inability to respond to texts. I procrastinate to an insane degree, I just can\u2019t. I don\u2019t even know how to properly explain it but my brain sees a notification (oftentimes from people I love) and just cannot open it and answer. Then it all starts to pile up and it just keeps getting worse. I procrastinate it until an embarrassingly long time has passed and the embarrassment just leads to more procrastination. I\u2019ve been stuck in this cycle for so long\u2026\n\nThis past year, a medical emergency (and it\u2019s aftermath) have made it all worse. If I\u2019m not mistaken, I think there are messages that have been there for longer than or almost a whole year (I know, it\u2019s really bad). \n\nFor whichever strategy I use next, I need to start with a clean slate. I need to answer all of those people, deal with all of those notifications. But what the heck do I say???\n\nI obviously want to apologize for taking so long. I\u2019m hesitant to promise I\u2019ll get better in the future because I had said that before and wasn\u2019t able to follow through. I also don\u2019t know if and how I should explain myself further. I could tell them about the medical thing, since it made my problem 10000x worse \u2014 but I\u2019ve  been told it might come off as a bad excuse, because I wasn\u2019t in a coma or anything, so I technically didn\u2019t actually lose the ability to answer my texts. I technically could not explain much (so as to not over-explain or overshare), but I feel like it could lead them to think I don\u2019t like them and don\u2019t care about answering them on a reasonable timeframe. I\u2019m not sure if there are other approaches that I could use, but regardless, I\u2019m SO lost and I need help.",

    "selftext": "Hey\u00a0[r/ADHD](/r/ADHD/)\u00a0\u2014 Long time lurker, first time poster. I have ADHD and I built an app for the specific way my brain works. Looking for beta testers who might relate.\n\nIt's called STASH \u2014 Shiny Things Are Stored Here.\n\nNot a productivity app. Not a to-do list. Something different.\n\nYou know that thing where you're driving, or falling asleep, or mid-conversation, and a thought lands that feels important \u2014 and then it's just gone? STASH is built for that moment. Speak it or type it in seconds, and it's captured before your brain moves on to the next shiny thing.\n\nBut here's where it gets interesting. STASH doesn't just store your thoughts \u2014 it remembers the context around them. Where you were, what time it was, how your energy felt, what was on your calendar. So when it surfaces something back to you, it's not just \"here's a thing you said\" \u2014 it's the whole moment.\n\nIt also finds connections between thoughts you didn't know were related. You stash something about a work idea on a Tuesday and something about a conversation with a friend on Thursday, and STASH notices they're actually about the same thing.\n\nIt's classified by what kind of thought it is \u2014 a reminder, a task, an idea, a question, a note \u2014 so you don't have to make that decision in the moment. Just stash it and trust that it'll be there when you need it.\n\nThere's also a cute squirrel. He collects acorns. He never dies.\n\nI'm looking for ADHD users who want to try it and tell me honestly what resonates and what doesn't. If you're interested, drop a comment or DM me and I'll send you the TestFlight link.\n\nWould love to hear from people who've felt like no app quite fits how their brain actually works.\n\nThanks!\n\nAndy\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention that it's iOS only.",

What study strategies helped you the most in large STEM classes?\n\nI mean if I didn\u2019t do good with the meds then idk what to do since I did horrible my entire life.\n\nAny advice someone\u2019s has \n\nDo I need new medication \n\nSome people study 30 min a day and get it meanwhile I\u2019m here doing hours on hours and still not doing good even with my meds",

Noone wants to speak deeply about anything, its just surface level joking and constant noise. Once I stopped asking people questions, the chats stopped completely. I cannot just start trying harder, as then I can feel myself physically burn out at a speed of a lit match. Everyday is a rollercoaster of emotions and when they get low, they get very low. I feel pathetic and hopeless, at work i feel so alone. The feeling is that of anger and loneliness. The people there are not inherently bad, I just dont feel like I can deal with the corporate small talk and constant stimulation from sources I dont find appealing.

Yeah you probably figured it out, why it's ended after 8 months. At the end of 2024 I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI.  \nAfter diagnosis my life started to be pretty cool. I've joined to theatre crew, start with cosplaying and went to Gamescom in Cologne. I'm working with therapist to this day, finding new methods to work with anxiety disorders, learning to love myself, even find out that I was actually psychological abused by my grandmother in childhood. Hell, I grew up in emotional neglect So yeah pretty ton of work and hours spend.\n\nBut in terms of finding love: Nothing changed. I was often among the people. I was DJ in university parties, I'm at a theatre crew, meeting new people at convents, even start with dating apps, but no dice. I have three ideas what's going on:  \n  \n1. I live in small city (&gt; 10 000, and more than half are elders.), and no one told me that dating apps doesn't fucking work correctly in small towns, even If i changed my location in app.  \n2. Maybe for 6 months, I'm actually in compatible environment, Because for the rest of previous 25 years I lived among neourotypical enginners, technicians, and other practical-boring-shit-hobby purists, while being a ADHD artist.  \n3. I can't read subtle signals (To be honest, I don't even know what the fuck is going on with them)\n\nI'm trying to find another reasons, or solutions for that problem, but on the internet no one give a shit about ADHD social people, that stay single for 5+ years. Only articles about problems in actual relationship, like finding a partner was an easy task accessible for every person in the world.\n\nAnd yes, I'm stucked in that loop, and don't know what to do. Many persons says that \"Do your hobbies and the right person find me\" but I hear that same phrase for 7 years, so give it up. I just want to be loved, and not suffer touch starvation",

I'm so boring and lack a personality and don't have any interests or hobbies or passions, I don't make up for being autistic and socially awkward by having good physical features like being tall or good-looking or other things like being smart or funny. Yet I always seek attention and try to get close to people, I always need intimacy. I'm always so bored and frustrated and in a bad mood and wanting to do something crazy or out of character, I can't be stable. I just obsess over random things and over people who show me the I'mslightest amount of kindness or understanding or people that I relate to. Sometimes I don't feel like a complete human, I just feel like I try to mirror other people or please them so they don't leave but I always say the wrong thing or say stupid things without meaning to. It gets so draining because I already know the result of every interaction is people not wanting anything to do with me ever again. ",

Vyvanse has helped a lot, but looking back at my kids\u2019 early years brings some sadness about not being as present as I could\u2019ve been. Curious if others relate.\n\nI\u2019m a 45 year old guy who was recently diagnosed with ADHD. I\u2019d wondered about it off and on over the years, but I was high functioning and had built solid systems that kept life moving. I\u2019ve had a genuinely good life. Great experiences, good career, healthy family. I feel lucky.\n\nTen years ago we had our first son, then our second three years later. About five years ago we moved across the country to start a business. Somewhere in that stretch, life outpaced my systems. Kids, a move, and a new business created a level of chaos I couldn\u2019t manage the same way. For years I felt scattered and behind, dropping balls and missing obligations.\n\nI never used to have much of a temper, but over the last several years my fuse got shorter. Nothing physical, just snapping too quickly, sometimes at my kids. Not terrible, but not who I wanted to be.\n\nAbout six weeks ago I started Vyvanse. The first day I felt\u2026 normal. I focused at work. I came home and tackled projects that had been sitting for over a year. I still feel steadier and more capable. Even if this is only part of what it ends up being, it\u2019s a big improvement. My baseline feels level.\n\nWhat really hit me was watching old videos of my kids at two or three. They were hilarious and full of life. I loved it, but it also made me sad. During those years I was stressed and distracted. I was there, but not always fully present. It feels like I missed pieces of something special.\n\nJust reflecting. For anyone who has had a late diagnosis and felt like this, what was your experience?",

To get a sense of it I've read quite a lot of Reddit posts on this, and came across equally abundant conflicting opinions on how to tackle the subject.  And along the way I managed to pick up two books 'Million Dollar Weekend' by Noah Kagan, and 'The Mom Test' by Rob Fitzpatrick.  Noah would say find 10 friends, make your sales pitch and ask if they would pay for it and collect payment up front if they say yes.  Rob would say don't ask your friends who would try to be nice and lie to soothe your ego.  \n\nOkay, so a lot of detours and I feel like I'm nowehere near getting to the bottom of it.  If anything, I feel more lost than ever as there are many sign posts pointing in different directions telling me where is the right way to go.  Not sure if it's just me, but this product validation business feels important but REALLY HARD at the same time.  And with so many conflicting and (misguided?) opinions out there, it still feels like trial and error in the end.\n\nSo I can't help but thinking that to build a successful startup what you seriously need is a lot of time and enough capital to burn through.  Since all the trials and errors until you hit the right approach materialise.  Or is it having access to successful founders who's made it (several times because they figured out the correct rinse and repeat formula to building startups)?  Is it just me, or others think so also?  And if you're a successful serial founder and don't mind to give me some advice without charging me I'd love to hear from you :).  \n\nAgain, this post is for entertainment purpose only.

I'm sure there's some AI writing that doesn't get spotted, and honestly that seems to me like less of a problem. Maybe pointing out stuff to slop writers is ushering in the era of the robot overlords, but at least Reddit will be a lot less of a slog.\n\nHere are the obvious tells. By the way, I'm going to use bullet pointing because this post is long. Yes, that's typically an AI tell. I'll mention it in the fourth point below.\n\n***\n\nHere goes nothing...\n\n* AI is getting smarter about m-dashes, but **the number one immediate indicator of AI slop is still a bunch of m-dashes**. If you're crying that you used a bunch of m-dashes before AI, you're probably a liar. For the scant few who are telling the truth, very sorry. Break the habit, at least for now.\n\n***\n\n* However, there is now a clear number two most obvious sign as well, and that is **sentences that start with the word \"Not\" or the phrase \"It's not\"**. AI (and especially ChatGPT) **loves the structure of \"Not ABC, but XYZ.\"** \n\nIt's eighth grade debate writing, and it's super-irritating that this is what it knows will get the most people's attention fastest. It's usually done in punchy little sentence fragments, frequently in their own paragraphs.\n\n***\n\n* Which brings us to the number three most obvious (and probably single most frequent) AI slop offender: **Short sentence fragments, tiny paragraphs, and especially single-sentence-fragment paragraphs.** \n\nIt does this for emphasis to quickly draw a distinction showing the most important aspect of whatever it's referring to. I think this is a method of assuring that a given point will reach every single reader, no matter how slow on the uptake. But who knows. Anyway, if your post is 80% one-line paragraphs, it's definitely AI.\n\n***\n\n* The fourth sign is bad news, because it was previously a sign of professionally-formatted writing: **numbered lists, bullet lists, or line breaks**. \n\nThis post was organized without numerals to distinguish from the way AI would do it, although I did keep the bullet points and line breaks, because I had to break all this text up somehow.

Yeesh, I'm not sure it's ethical to explicitly empower the sloppers.\n\nThen again, the reading on Reddit would get a **lot** less brutal. (There's a one-sentence paragraph. AI slop!)\n\n...\n\nNah, can't do it. The brighter ones won't need instructions from here on how to fix there stuff.\n\nTo a slop-free world, I guess?\n\nHugs,\nINP",

It connects to gmail, slack, github, notion, telegram, linkedin. It has a feature where you highlight text anywhere and tell it what to do and it transforms it in place. It' s live on iOS, Mac, Android, Windows and Linux. Free. No ads.\n\nI'm writing this because every week on this sub I see posts about \"how I made $50K in 30 days\" and \"my SaaS hit $10K MRR\" and nobody talks about the brutal middle part where you built something real and the world just doesn't care yet.\n\nHere's what I've learned so far about that gap.\n\nBuilding is the easy part. I know that sounds backwards but hear me out. Building is just solving problems one at a time. Its logical. You can see progress every day. Something is broken, you fix it. Something is missing, you add it. You go to bed feeling like you accomplished something.\n\nMarketing with zero budget is a completely different animal. There is no feedback loop. You post something and nothing happens. You post again and nothing happens. You have no idea if the product is wrong or the marketing is wrong or both or neither and you just need more time.\n\nThe hardest part isnt the work. It's the silence. When you're building you're in a conversation with the code. When you're marketing to nobody you're shouting into a void and the void does not shout back.\n\nSome things I've tried so far and what happened.\n\nCold outreach to youtubers. Sent about 30 messages. Got 2 replies. One said \"looks cool\" and never followed up. Zero coverage.\n\nReddit. Still figuring this out. It's the most promising channel because people actually engage. But every sub has different rules about self promotion and most of them will ban you for mentioning your own product.\n\nProduct hunt. Haven't launched yet. Saving it for when I have at least some social proof.\n\nWhat I wish someone told me before I started. Distribution is not a phase that comes after building. It should be the thing you build first. I built the product I wanted to exist and figured I'd \"figure out marketing later.\" That was a mistake. If I started over I'd build an audience for 6 months and then build the product.\n\nI'm not quitting. The product is good. People who try it stick with it. The problem is getting people to try it. If you're in this same gap between building something real and getting anyone to notice, I'd love to hear what worked for you.",

We decided to make our response time our primary competitive advantage.\n\n# The Workflow\n\nWe built a \"Strike Team\" workflow (which is literally just me and one assistant) to catch these signals in real time.\n\n1. **The Trigger:** We monitor specific \"vulnerability\" keywords for our top five competitors. We don't just track their brand names. We track their names plus words like \"alternative,\" \"broken,\" \"slow,\" or \"overpriced.\"\n2. **The Contextual Reply:** When a signal hits, we don't send a sales pitch. We jump into the thread and offer immediate, specific help.\n   * **Example:** \"I saw you're struggling with that API integration. We actually built our tool specifically to solve that because we had the same issue. Happy to give you a free 3 month trial to help you migrate over today.\"\n3. **The Closing:** We offer a \"Concierge Migration.\" If they are leaving a big player, they are usually terrified of the data move. We tell them we\u2019ll do the heavy lifting for them.\n\n# Our Results\n\n|**Metric**|**Google Ads (Old Way)**|**Social Intent (The New Way)**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Budget**|$2,000/mo minimum|$0 in Ad Spend|\n|**Conversion Rate**|2-3%|15-20%|\n|**Lead Quality**|Just browsing|Ready to switch NOW|\n|**Customer Vibe**|Just another ad|You guys are a lifesaver|\n\nThe giants in your industry are moving too fast to care about a single frustrated tweet or Reddit thread. That frustration is your market opportunity.\n\nIn 60 days, we messaged 42 accounts for nearly $0 CAC (just software), and we closed 8 of those leads, adding over $1.5k MRR.",

Revenue was okay but i was constantly context switching and burning out managing 14 completely different industries at once.\n\nThen one of my clients, a pediatric dentist in Scottsdale, referred me to her friend who also owned a pediatric dental practice. I didnt think much of it but after working with both of them for a few months I realized these businesses are basically identical in structure, same ad angles work, same seasonal trends, same parent demographics on Meta, same Google review strategy. I wasnt reinventing the wheel every time.\n\nSo I made the call to niche down completely. Updated my website, killed all other outreach, built out a proper case study from those two clients and just started cold emailing pediatric dental offices.\n\nFirst 60 days were rough ngl. Had some money saved from before I went full time that covered my personal expenses which was the only reason i didnt panic and go back to taking random clients. By month 3 I had 3 new clients purely from outreach. By month 6 referrals started coming in from within the niche itself because these dentists all know each other and talk.\n\nThe thing nobody tells you about niching is that your deliverables get so much faster. I can onboard a new pediatric dental client in 2 days now because everything is templated from experience. My margins went up without raising prices just from the efficiency alone.\n\nIf your agency feels chaotic and all over the place this is genuinely worth considering. Pick the niche that already has some proof in your current client list.",

Nothing ever made me feel like I was going to regret NOT doing it.\n\nAI is different.\n\nThis isn't like other industries where you can wait and see. If you're not building right now you're going to look back in 3 years and feel it. That's genuinely how I see it after spending the last 9 months deep in this space.\n\nSo I went all in and started building. The problem I kept hitting was spending more time transferring context between AI tools than actually building anything. ChatGPT for planning, Claude for execution, and me in the middle copy-pasting like an idiot every single session. I got obsessed with solving that specific problem and it became the thing I've been heads down on for the past 3 months.\n\nThe thing that surprised me most wasn't the product. It was how much the industry has changed in just 9 months of paying close attention.\n\nA year ago, people were saying vibe coding was a joke. Now the same people are using it to ship real products. The tools got better, but more importantly, the prompting got better. That's the real unlock, treating prompting like a skill worth actually investing in rather than just typing and hoping.\n\nMost people spend 80% of their time on the product and 20% on how they communicate with the AI. Flip that ratio and everything changes.\n\nStill early. Still figuring out the business side. But I've never been more sure I'm working on the right thing at the right time.",

    "selftext": "Before I transitioned to a founder, I spent years working as a UI/UX designer. My entire mindset back then was trying to reinvent the wheel. Every new client project felt like an excuse to build a \"masterpiece\" - custom scroll behaviors, hidden avant-garde menus, totally unique layouts.\n\nAnd users didn't give a damn about my buttery smooth micro-animations. They were just annoyed because they couldn't quickly find the pricing page and they wanted to know what the product did, how much it cost, and where the damn sign-up button was.\n\nIt took me a long time to swallow my pride and realize that people actually want boring, predictable layouts.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason 90% of SaaS landing pages look exactly the same today (big hero text, social proof logos, 3-column features, pricing table). If you make them learn a completely new way to navigate just to read your features, they will just bounce.\n\nAnd this rule applies way beyond just web design. Think about pricing models, for example. As founders, we sometimes try to invent \"clever\" token systems or complex dynamic tiers to optimize revenue. But users hate doing math just to buy software. They usually just want a boring, predictable flat monthly fee so they know exactly what to budget. Simple always wins.\n\nWe founders (and designers) can chase \"perfection\" and \"uniqueness\" all day long. I carry this with me now while building my AI website builder. I literally have to fight my own designer instincts every single day to keep things standard and straightforward instead of \"innovative.\"\n\nHave any of you had to kill a feature or an idea you were personally super proud of, just because the \"boring\" standard version converted better?",

    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been digging into how some newer platforms are navigating U.S. gambling laws and the sweepstakes model is honestly kind of brilliant. Instead of going state by state for full sportsbook licensing, they operate under sweepstakes law, which allows broader access while still staying legal. That dramatically lowers regulatory friction and expands distribution, which in a heavily restricted industry is a huge competitive edge. A good example is Bracco. They use the sweepstakes structure but still focus on tight pricing, transparent limits and fast payouts, which makes it feel closer to a traditional sharp sportsbook rather than a gimmicky promo site. From a business perspective it\u2019s an interesting blend of efficient pricing and sportsbook UX, built for scale instead of just survival. Whether you\u2019re into betting or not, the model itself is a fascinating workaround in a highly regulated space.\n\nI want to know if this is sustainable long term or just the next evolution of compliance strategy?",

For a while now, I've had a strong entrepreneurial drive and a desire to build something of my own alongside the full time job (that is if nothing goes wrong on my current internship).\n\nI'm planning to start a small scale production of decorative stone wall panels (brick imitation, different patterns), mainly for interior use at the beginning. The idea is to run it as a small business on the side, with the potential to expand later into exterior products using different materials beyond gypsum, I'll try to upload a picture in comments from a random shop so you get the idea.\n\nI've done my research on the business model and analyzed the market (I am in Southeastern Europe). There seems to be demand and space to enter, but I'm fully aware that theory and planning are very different from actually running production, dealing with customers, quality control, logistics, and everything in between.\n\nI'd really appreciate hearing from people who have started a manufacturing business, especially in construction or home decor, or anyone who might have good advice.\n\nIf you were starting over today, what would you focus on the most? What are the most common mistakes small manufacturing businesses make early on? In a niche like this, how important is marketing compared to pure product quality? And would you recommend starting as lean as possible to validate demand first, or investing upfront in a more serious setup? If someone had experience with molds from alibaba could you recommend a seller? Marketing advice would really help also.\n\nI'm open to honest feedback, it's important to say that I do have time for this even with working full time job and I do have some people who could help me, the sales would go through social media, also through my country's marketplace platform and also I would be running own web shop, I'd do my best to get good SEO because it's a specific niche in my market not that many people are doing this, also run marketing but as I said I need advice for that too.\n\nThanks in advance to anyone willing to share their experience.",

It\u2019s a reality check for anyone selling specialty or ethnic products in the U.S.\n\n**Product:** German coffee brand (strong in Europe, low awareness in the U.S.)  \n**Market:** U.S.  \n**Goal:** Sales, not traffic  \n**Campaign type:** Performance Max (PMax)\n\nHere\u2019s what actually matters.  \n\n\n**Brand search volume is everything**\n\nIf the brand already has search demand, PMax will look smart. It will scoop up branded queries and convert them efficiently.\n\nIf there\u2019s no existing demand, PMax won\u2019t magically create it. It optimizes what\u2019s already happening. It\u2019s not a demand generator - mind it\n\nWhat this really means is you need to know whether you\u2019re scaling demand or just capturing it. Two very different games. So anyone who's still figuring out, stick to search and display ads.\n\n\n\n**Asset quality matters more than most people think**\n\nPMax forces you to feed it headlines, descriptions, and creative variations. We tested multiple angles:\n\n* Authentic German import positioning\n* Specific product names (Prodomo, Crema d\u2019Oro, Gold Instant, Decaf)\n* Scarcity messaging\n* Generic premium coffee language\n\nThe ads that mentioned specific SKUs and clear product types performed better than fluffy premium language. Infact our graphics was just a random product with a backdrop LOL  \n\n\n**If you don\u2019t segment intent, PMax will mix it**\n\nWe structured assets around brand-specific intent. When you let everything live in one messy bucket, Google blends audiences and signals in ways that can blur performance.\n\nIf you\u2019re selling both branded and non-branded traffic in the same campaign, you may not actually know what\u2019s driving revenue.\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t know that, you can\u2019t scale intelligently. So segregation and analytical identification are KEYs\n\n\n\n**PMax is lazy with weak signals**\n\nIf your product feed, copy, and landing pages aren\u2019t tight, PMax won\u2019t compensate. It will just drift toward whatever converts easiest. For us, since we were handling the SEO too, we took care of site quality even before launching the test. We also optimized the followings for consumers\n\n* Clear product titles\n* Strong feed data\n* Clean SKU structure\n* Dedicated landing pages for each product\n\n\n\n**Imported or niche brands need education**\n\nIf you\u2019re selling something people don\u2019t already search for, you need top-of-funnel work. PMax alone won\u2019t build awareness. So the right approach is to start with generic search ads. We had SEO and search ads were ran by client a few times\n\n\n\n**Don\u2019t confuse revenue with strategy**\n\nIf your PMax campaign is \u201cprofitable,\u201d you should ask or atleast seek clarifications on-\n\n* Is it mostly branded traffic?\n* Would those customers have bought anyway?\n* Are we expanding the customer base or just re-harvesting it?\n\nA lot of ecommerce owners celebrate ROAS without understanding incrementality. We are halfway there, and scaling it as we speak\n\nWhat I\u2019d suggest any FMCG/D2C/Local businesses right now is to first isolate branded from non-branded performance. No need to run ads on terms that could have usually landed you a sale\n\ntry and let me know how it goes :)",

    "selftext": "Hi guys I wanted to ask for help on career advice that maybe some of you can relate to.\n\nI am a couple years out of undergrad where I studied computer engineering, and interned at big tech and startup in the West Coast. Right after college I joined my family business (manufacturing and wholesale of CPG), and I\u2019ve done decently well. At this point I am done following my family\u2019s footsteps and I am interested in pursuing working in the tech industry again, esp with all of the exciting AI Startups now (would be a dream to get into YC and start a software startup of my own).\n\nI have been experimenting with vibe coding tools like cursor and Claude, and I have been making some prototypes for a B2B saas idea. I understand that for it to truly be a legit software startup, I am nowhere close to that.\n\nI was thinking that I should get a job within a tech startup/corporate first in order to learn the ropes so that I would have the right experience to start my own thing.  It\u2019s been several years so I\u2019ve incredibly rusty in my technical skills, and I have high doubts about my employability since ive only worked in B2B sales and distribution in the physical product space, and idk how transferable any of my skills are from my family business. I know that currently the tech industry is not doing well in terms of hiring people.\n\nShould I go to grad school and get enough technical skills for me to start my own startup, or am I just fantasizing about the AI boom at the moment and I should just be realistic and stick with my family business that is already doing well? I am just so fascinated by all the advancements of AI that I would honestly love to be part of this societal growth and I do not have much interest in my family industry at all. \n\nAny feedback or advice is absolutely appreciated. I understand this sort of post is a bit different from the other posts and I will accept the hate but this is a genuine struggle that I have been dealing with for months. Thank you so much ",

    "selftext": "How real-time settlement reshapes everyday financial support across borders.\n\n\u200d\n\nTL;DR\n\nAgentic wallets bypass 3-5 day bank transfers for remittances, offering instant, low-cost support for migrant workers and families.\n\n\u200d\n\nThe Remittance Struggle: Fees, Delays, and Broken Cycles\n\nAnyone who has worked closely with migrant communities has heard the same stories repeated again and again. Hard-earned wages are sent home, only for 6 to 7 percent to disappear in fees. Families then wait days, sometimes longer, for the money to arrive. These delays and costs are not just inconvenient. They actively reinforce cycles of poverty and financial stress.\n\nIn a world where communication and commerce move instantly, this lag feels outdated and deeply unfair. Billions of dollars are lost each year simply moving money across borders.\n\nThe data backs this up. According to the World Bank\u2019s Remittance Prices Worldwide report, the global average cost of sending a $200 remittance was 6.49 percent in Q1 2025, more than double the UN Sustainable Development Goal target of 3 percent.\n\nAt the same time, remittance flows to low- and middle-income countries have reached roughly $685 to $690 billion annually, with projections of around $690 billion in 2025.\u00a0\n\nDespite their scale and importance, most remittances still take one to five business days to settle, and often longer in complex corridors. During crises, these delays become even more dangerous. UN assessments consistently show that migrant workers and their families face heightened financial risk when access to funds is slowed or interrupted.\n\nHigh transfer costs directly reduce the money households receive. That means less spending on essentials like food, healthcare, and education, and greater reliance on credit to smooth day-to-day needs. World Bank research shows that while remittances generally boost household consumption, high fees limit these gains, especially for poorer families. When costs are high, disposable income shrinks, non-essential purchases are cut, and long-term economic contributions are constrained.\n\nThe difference becomes clear when comparing how funds actually move through each system:\n\nAgentic Wallets: Automating Global Support\u200d\n\nAgentic wallets offer a fundamentally different approach.\n\nInstead of treating remittances as one-off transactions, agentic wallets use autonomous agents to manage recurring transfers intelligently. These agents can optimize currency conversions, hedge foreign exchange risk, allocate funds to bills or savings, and even invest surpluses, all automatically and in seconds.\n\nWith built-in support for global stablecoins, agentic wallets enable fee-free or near-zero-cost transfers with near-instant settlement. This stands in stark contrast to traditional providers like Western Union, where total costs including fees and exchange rate markups typically range from 5 to 7 percent on average. Transfer times vary widely, from minutes for cash pickup to several business days for bank deposits.\n\nAgentic wallets rely on blockchain-based settlement and real-time verification, which drives costs close to zero and reduces settlement times to minutes. For migrant workers who may not be familiar with currency swaps, exchange rates, or financial tools, the value is clear. The AI handles complexity in the background, making the process simple, predictable, and reliable.\n\nThe result is not just faster payments, but peace of mind. Families receive support when they need it, without unnecessary loss along the way.\n\n\u200d\n\nVisionary Scenarios: Empowering Migrant Lives\n\nThe real promise of agentic wallets goes beyond speed and cost.\n\nImagine scheduled remittances that automatically adjust for currency volatility, protecting families from sudden swings. Imagine seamless local fiat on-ramps, or community-based pooled funds that can respond instantly to emergencies. Early solutions in this space already demonstrate fee reductions of up to 90 percent compared to traditional channels.\n\nRegulatory and compliance challenges remain, and they must be addressed responsibly. But the potential human impact is profound. Lower costs and faster access to money translate directly into greater stability, resilience, and opportunity for millions of families worldwide.",

People are engaging. The numbers look good. And then... nothing happens.\n\nLinkedIn post: 5.6k views, 72 likes, 23 comments, 3 reposts. Bunch of people connected with me after. Zero leads.\n\nReddit post: 5.8k views, 14 upvotes, 21 comments. Couple DMs. Both were people trying to sell me their product.\n\nThe engagement says people care. The results say they don't care enough to actually do anything.\n\nAnd the worst part? You start questioning everything. Is my content actually good or are people just being polite? Am I targeting the wrong audience? Should I be more direct? Less direct? Maybe I need better calls to action? Maybe I need to post at different times?\n\nYou analyze what worked and what didn't. You watch YouTube videos from the gurus. You try replicating what successful people do. Sometimes it works. Usually it doesn't.\n\nI think the real problem is simpler than we make it.\n\nPeople engage with content in the moment they're feeling something. A post resonates. They like it, comment on it, maybe even share it. In that moment, they're interested.\n\nBut then what? They scroll away. The moment passes. If they wanted to reach out or sign up for something, they'd have to stop scrolling, remember why they cared, find your link, and take action.\n\nMost people just don't. Not because they weren't interested. Because the gap between \"this resonates\" and \"I should do something about this\" is too big.\n\nI've been working on something in the video space that's trying to solve a version of this problem. Let people raise their hand the second they're feeling it, not five minutes later when they have to reconstruct why they cared.\n\nEarly results are interesting. Two creators got their first leads at 150-180 views when industry benchmarks suggest they'd need a few thousand. I think it's because we're catching people in the moment instead of hoping they remember to come back later.\n\nStill figuring it out. But the pattern keeps showing up: the closer you can get the action to the moment someone feels something, the more likely they are to actually take it.\n\nThe gap is where everything dies.",

Tally got 2000 users from this, 17x better conversion than Google.\n\n**5. Signal Search** \\- YouTube destroys other channels (80-90% of revenue). Local Rank proved this.\n\n**6.

Here\u2019s the frustrating part i often share these tours through emails, newsletters, and social media posts. Sometimes even create little guides or lists of my favorite experiences for specific destinations but noticed that a lot of clients will click on my links, save them, and then book the tours directly on the operator\u2019s website later or worse, through a generic booking portal i dont control. That means all the time and effort i put into marketing and guiding them disappears, and I get zero credit or commission. It\u2019s especially tricky with high demand or seasonal tours. For example, i once promoted a limited access sunset cruise in Santorini during peak season. I sent it out to a few clients i thought would be interested. One client bookmarked the page and didn\u2019t book immediately, and by the time they decided to purchase, they booked directly. I felt like i literally just handed potential revenue to the operator for free. I\u2019ve tried creating spreadsheets, sending personalized reminders, and even managing smart links to track engagement, but it\u2019s hard to know what actually works. It feels like im marketing, project managing, and selling all at once and still taking a huge risk that I might not get credit for the work i do.",

I tried a basic website and posting on local facebook groups but it barely moves the needle. overhead is low, just permits and transit at $200 a month, but without steady groups we cant cover basics. people loved his personal touch, the way hed stop for coffee at a spot with history or adjust for kids in the group.\n\nI want to honor what he built without turning it into some generic bus thing. for anyone whos scaled small tours or personal guides: what got you past the word of mouth phase, did you find platforms that connect groups without high fees?\u00a0\n\nThank you everyone.",

    "selftext": "I am a medical radiation therapist by training. I worked for 7 years as an MRT in Canada treating cancer patients, calculating dose profiles, and discussing side effects with my patients. I have no formal software development experience. I have always had a deep interest in computers and programming, but I just couldn't reach that \"make a career out of it\" point. I tried a few times to switch careers, but the technical hurdles were either too time-consuming to overcome, or too great of a challenge for my non-engineering self.\n\nIt wasn't until I started travelling more and more after Covid that I started realizing there was a very real problem. I didn't know \"what\" exactly that problem was at the time, but I knew it was something. I loved travelling, but I dreaded the idea of having to plan the trip and spend countless hours debating and arguing with my friends over what to do, where to go, how long to spend in this city or that city, etc etc.\n\nIn early 2024 I had just quit my job at the hospital I worked at and spent the next \\~two-ish years traveling. I visited Chile, Ecuador, Taiwan, the United States, Bali, and numerous other places. Each time the feeling was the same: I was exicted for the trip, but I wasn't excited to actually \\*plan\\* the trip. I hated that part. I hated having 30 Chrome tabs open and a collaborative spreadsheet with my cousins about where to eat on this day, or how to get from Santiago to Atacama. Even in Singapore, we would waste hours trying to decide where to go next. Instead of enjoying the trip, we were deadlocked in Chrome tabs and more spreadsheets. I knew something had to be done...I just wasn't ready to do it yet.\n\nIn early 2025 I moved from Ontario to British Columbia as I returned to the field of medical radiation therapy at a new hospital in Vancouver. During this year I did what most people in the pacific northwest love doing: hike mountains, go camping, and live that hippy lifestyle. March became April, April became May, and before I knew it, it was October and I hadn't thought about the pains of travelling at all...\n\n...until my cousin invited me into the Japan 2026 group chat. Oh no, not this again. I knew there was no way I was going to deal with the planning fatigue again. This was the wake-up call I needed to do something about it, and so I did.\n\nI recently learned about Claude Code and how it's lowered the barrier of entry for many developers. It allows you to take your idea from imagination to reality. I bought a Claude Max subscription, and off I went.\n\nI spent the next three months developing an app. I knew the problem, and I came up with a solution: Pre-curated, remixable itineraries, for any mood or style. Instead of spending 20 hours planning a trip, just pick one and go. 14 day Grand Tour of Japan via public transporation? It's on there. A 3-day chill experience through Montreal? The app has it.\n\nBut that wasn't enough. What if you wanted to do this thing, but not that thing? Or if you wanted to spend one extra day, or one fewer day? I came up with a solution to that as well: Remix. Instantly change the pace of any itinerary, and prioritize/deprioritize what you're interested in, whether it's shopping, sight-seeing, or food. The app lets you customize it to your liking.\n\nIt's now February, and my first iOS app was just accepted and approved on the Apple app store. The excitement I got from seeing the \"approved\" notification was a feeling I haven't felt in a long, long time.\n\nI'm a self-taught solo developer. I was learning how to develop an iOS app + a website at the same time. I've spent many, many sleepless nights debugging issues with Firebase, Vercel, and trying to figure out what on earth a Google serviceAccountKey is. But I learned...slowly at first, and then consistently.\n\nI am now developing the Android port of my app, and it's a completely new experience. It's not as simple as just changing some values in Swift and calling it a day; it requires a rebuild from the ground up, basically. Apple's MapKit doesn't translate properly to Google Maps' SDK. Some of my features won't work at all, but that's okay. It's a learning experience.\n\nI haven't stopped there. Along with building my app, I started a second company to tackle other challenges my cousin has repeatedly mentioned in regards to the mortgage brokering industry. This had led to the development of two novel automation software tools...but we aren't ready to discuss those yet.\n\nDid I say \"we\"? While the travel app is my solo project, my other company now comprises of three founders, both of whom are my cousins. Upon founding the company and working away on the products for a few weeks, I had a major realization: I am good at building the tech, but I am not good at running the company. I asked my older cousin, a staff engineer at a US-based tech firm, to take over as CEO, while I focus on the tech stack as CTO. Giving up equity in your own company is always difficult, but for the company to actually grow, it needed real engineering leadership. As for my other cousin, she is handling the product design as Chief Product Officer.\n\nI'm 32 years old and have basically shifted the entire trajectory of my life. I transitioned away from the medical field and into software development. I've now started two companies, gave up a stable salary to make $0 in app revenue, and am now both a solo developer at one company, and the Chief Technical Officer at another. I'm unsure where this goes from here...but I'm excited to find out.",

    "selftext": "A provocative headline for my first post here, but I genuinely hope it's useful to someone!\n\nI have a VC backed startup in the identity and privacy space (OIDC), and while onboarding a customer last year, we would often get sidetracked, talking about actions and privacy violations happening in the U.S. around personal data. \n\nI explained over time how I used to write for HuffPo on privacy where I'd be warning about jurisdictional privacy and dangers of the U.S. CLOUD Act over a decade ago, and that I haven't used American tech services for my businesses in over a decade since, which honestly costs a lot of time and money to make such a principled stance -- but it's negotiable for me, we only host data in countries with strong privacy laws and regulators that actually enforce them. There were many cases this last year that would also impact her American customer base in the health tech space. \n\nShe then asked something I wasn't expecting -- could she move her customer data and tech completely off \"the cloud\" (meaning American owned infrastructure), and then also leave the Apple and Google app stores, and use use our infrastructure instead. I'd been explaining how a progressive web app (PWA) would solve for this, so that part made sense. \n\nI told her honestly that we'd build this infrastructure for ourselves over the years, not for customers, but sure, let's explore it. Then it got interesting. \n\nShe was also fed up with her existing dev shop, and one thing led to another, and she offered us over $30k/month contract to host all her data, and take over all development and operations. I immediately incorporated a new company in B.C. (Canada), never looking a gift horse in the mouth, started mentioning it to a few other people, and by the end of the first month we were over $60k/month MRR -- these were all subscription based contracts, not one offs. \n\nGenuinely the the best startup problem I've ever had. All hot inbound, no cold outreach, just trying to keep up with customer demand. If you've ever slogged through cold sales, you know why I'm not taking this for granted. \n\nWhat's kept customers is pretty simple and apparently pretty rare: we've never missed a single milestone we committed to. Not one. Every single customer has told us that they've never experienced that with a dev or ops shop before, I didn't expect that to become part of our brand, but here we are. \n\nCritics can call us a glorified web dev shop and they're technically not wrong. Our data sovereignty angle creates something unique. I've got +25 years in privacy &amp; security so this isn't a trend I've pivoted into, it's been my thing my thing throughout my professional life, and credibility is documented. It also helps that customers from my identity startup tend to want this company's services too, and vice versa, they feed each other naturally. \n\nOur customers are mostly European, where GDPR has been deeply ingrained in how they think about personal data, not just a compliance thing. They see personal data as a liability rather than an asset, which is exactly our worldview. I honestly don't even bother trying to sell to companies that see personal data as the thing to monetize as it's a value misalignment and counter productive. Most American VC money flows easiest when your model involves harvesting and selling personal data, but that's not the game we're playing, and we're seeing the tides shift slowly in this area for those playing the long game. \n\nThe competitive angle is real though. Take a femtech menstrual tracking app built on our privacy first OIDC, that customer can tell its users \"we don't even known your real name or email address\" which gives them a competitive edge in their marketplace, and all of our customers have that. That's not just spin, that's how it works architecturally. And after Flo just paid out \\~25 million in settlements over user data misuse, being able to say a breach of your systems exposes essentially nothing is a pretty compelling story to tell your customers -- and it massively reduces your own business risk too.\n\nThe timing has been wildly in our favour. Microsoft admitted it can't guarantee it can protect EU customer data from U.S. government snooping, and a similar case here in Canada all in the last year, and this has had a ripple effect across the world. Canada's Prime Minister is now calling data sovereignty a national priority -- I was writing about this stuff a decade ago and was mostly ignored. American companies and minority groups inside the U.S. are now looking to move sensitive data off of American infrastructure even, especially those that want global trust. I don't know exactly where this goes, but I don't see it slowing down this year. \n\nIf any of this is useful as a takeaway, for me it would come down to the fact I actually believed in this before there was money in it, I said yes to an unexpected pivot when the fit was real, and we just did what we said what we would do, every time. That last one sounds boring, but it's apparently enough to stand out on its own. \n\nAs a startup advisor I've always pushed people to validate the pain point before building anything -- don't build an MVP and hope customers show up (This is changing in a post openclaw world, I said this when an MVP took 3-24 months to build). If the pain is real, people will pay you to build the solution which is not intuitive to many. This company is a pretty clean example of that playing out. \n\nRunning a startup with revenue and profit out of the date isn't all roses -- I'm regularly up until 4am, most of job is triage and firefighting, and this is what I signed up for, and I guess what everyone reading this is signing up for too.  \n  \nI'm happy to answer questions on the infrastructure decisions, data sovereignty specifics, privacy/security, startup things, or honestly almost anything really :D  \n\nThanks for reading!\n\n",

In my spare time I do a lot of researching about history and the sorts and discovered that the late Pythagorean had a sort of cult that never ate animals and that got me thinking about the meat industry and my own personal impact on it. I decided that for my own health (already anemic) it\u2019s important that I still eat things like beef and chicken but I know how much of an issue this is both morally and for life on earth and that\u2019s when it hit me. Moose. I think that if we start building buildings in the North of the U.S. to create Moose slaughter houses it could change life as we know it. I know this doesn\u2019t address the moral issues of eating animals entirely but since the Moose is such a big animal we would have to kill lots less of them for even more meat than that of a cow and I imagine that a Moose farm would be as easy to do as a cow farm if not more. I\u2019m wondering if there are any Moose farmers that would be willing to implement it, I\u2019ve been doing a lot of work on this and I think that a good first step would be making cat food out of the animal and then slowly introducing people to it. Anyone have any ideas of where I can take this to to receive funding? I think this might be what I was born for, honestly. Thank you all!!",

    "selftext": "I'm currently building my first Sales OS in Toronto after 20 years in enterprise sales. Last week, while architecting our qualification logic, I remembered the two funnels that my first CEO made for me back in Hong Kong...\n\nWhen I was a junior salesperson...\n\nMy first role in B2B sales started in Hong Kong at a startup selling security solutions to government departments and FBI clients (financial institutions, banks, and insurers).\n\nOur competitors were giants like IBM, PCCW, and a few other US technology companies.\n\nWonder why government departments and FBI would consider solutions from a startup like my company? We did have our unique selling point (USP) - a strong technology incubator supported by university professors.\n\nAnyway, being a new and much smaller player, our actual chances of winning deals relied heavily on our sales team - how we managed the selling cycle.\n\nMy boss - the CEO - a senior enterprise sales manager from US...\n\nI was the most junior salesperson, and the whole sales team was onboarded on the same day.\n\nOur CEO was not the founder. He joined the company a few months before we did. Before joining the company, he was a senior sales manager at HP in the United States. His key roles as a CEO were very clear - sales team management and building a revenue generation engine.\n\nComing from an engineering education background, I articulated our technical solutions with confidence. Our CEO was satisfied. I felt ready to enter the battlefield - sales outreach.\n\nEntering the Battlefield - My Outreach starts...\n\nThe security solutions market at that time was not as saturated as it is today. Most companies were curious about solutions in security (remember: \u201ccurious\u201d). The company received phone and email inquiries pretty often.\n\nI was assigned several sales leads from local financial institutions.\n\nBTW, I felt lucky that I did not have to do the cold calling, which I believe most salespeople hate. (However, later in my career, cold calling and even \u201ccatching\u201d my target clients onsite can be crucial for increasing your win rate dramatically in the sales cycle. I will share in coming future.)\n\nAlright! Back to my assigned leads: I did my \u201chomework\u201d - prepared for my meetings by checking clients\u2019 websites and news - then picked up the phone, made the call, and arranged meetings with the clients.\n\nMy FIRST most important sales lesson...\n\nEverything seemed smooth until one day - I returned to the office after my client meeting. I felt like I was a diligent and effective salesperson. However, my CEO was surprised that I met the client. He was obviously annoyed.\n\n\u201cAmice, how can you meet the client without any preparation?!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell...I have done some digging online before going out,\u201d I replied, puzzled.\n\nI was thinking, what kind of 'preparation' does he mean?\n\n\u201cYou have a lot of spare time?\u201d he snapped.\n\n\u201cAr.....sorry, what do you mean? What is the issue?\u201d I was still puzzled.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you. You are wasting your time!\n\nYour time is an expensive company resource.\u201d\n\nI thought: \u201cIsn\u2019t meeting clients the job of a salesperson?\u201d    | \u2018\\_\u2019 |||\n\nThe math of the selling cycle come....\n\nHe sat me down and explained the math of a typical B2B Sales Funnel:\n\npitch \u2192 needs discovery \u2192 proposal \u2192 objection/negotiation \u2192 deal\n\nie. The \u201cSelling Cycle\u201d.\n\nHe said, \u201cIf you want 10 clients to give us business, and assumed 50% chance to proceed to each next step, you will need to pitch : 10 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 =\u00a0160\u00a0clients.\n\nDon\u2019t forget we assume optimistically 50% each stage!\n\nWhat about the chance to move to each next step of the selling cycle drops to 33%?\n\nYou will need to pitch : 10 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 =\u00a0810\u00a0clients.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Today, you are starting with such an approach.\n\nYou will never succeed, Amice.\u201d\n\nI was totally speechless. I suddenly felt I had picked the wrong role in my career. \u00a0\u00a0 | \u2018\\_\u2019 |||\n\nThe skinny funnel strategy...\n\nHe comforted me, \u201cWe are not targeting this.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to do 810 sales pitches.\"\n\nHe started drawing a second funnel, but an obviously narrow one on the whiteboard and explained,\n\n\u201cThe first and most important step in the selling cycle is to disqualify leads as early as possible.\n\nHe said, \u201cIf you want 10 clients to give us business, and assumed 50% chance to proceed to each next step, you will need to pitch : 10 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 =\u00a0160\u00a0clients.\n\nDon\u2019t forget we assume optimistically 50% each stage!\n\nWhat about the chance to move to each next step of the selling cycle drops to 33%?\n\nYou will need to pitch : 10 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 =\u00a0810\u00a0clients.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Today, you are starting with such an approach.\n\nYou will never succeed, Amice.\u201d\n\nI was totally speechless.

    "selftext": "I have been working on my AI startup and really amazed by the valuation dynamics in AI startups and would really appreciate perspectives from experienced founders, investors, and operators on how realistic it is to scale and AI startup's valuation to a billion dollar within four months. In the current market, we've seen rapid valuation spikes driven by breakthrough models, distribution leverage, startegic partnerships, and aggressive venture funding, but I'm trying to separate hype from structural value creation.\n\nFrom your experience, what actually drives institutional investors to assign unicorn-level valuations so quickly- propreitary models, defensible data moats or similar capital momentum ? If one were intentionally attempting  to scale in an accelerated timeframe, what would need to align simultaneously ?? I'm particularly interested in whether this kind of hyper-scaling is realistically achevable through fundamentals alone, or if requires a combination of timing, capital markets conditions, and strategic signaling. Would love to hear grounded insights......",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone! I wanted everyone's thoughts on taxes (I'm in TX), and just the potential business in general. I've been simmering on the idea of restarting my custom cookies business, but I've been afraid of what taxes might look like.\n\nFor some background, I used to sell custom decorated cookies back in college for some extra cash on the side. I gained 1k followers on IG within a year of doing it part-time, and I still get tons of inquiries to this day. It has been about 4 years since then.\n\nI want to reignite this and take this business to the next level by selling the following:\n\n1) Custom cookies - various tiers\n2) Pre-made holiday sets\n3) DIY cookie kits\n4) Online course packages\n5) Physical courses\n6) Farmers Markets\n7) Corporate partnerships\n\nItems 2 -7 were all markets that I wasn't even touching before. I would also focus more on marketing and have a better system in place. \n\nI'm afraid to take this leap because I am working full-time right now and that is stable. However, with the current job market and economy, and the state of the company i work for (unstable), this is seemingly more attractive at this point.\n\nTaxes are my number one concern with starting this business because I'm reading that I would pay federal taxes and self-employed income taxes. Is there a loophole around this? It seems like it's just not worth it when I consider taxes, and that's kind of discouraging.\n\nAlso, I am very new to all of this. Any and all help is appreciated! And if anyone is open to chatting about their success as an entrepreneur, I would love that too. Thank you all. :)",

    "selftext": "I spent the last few weeks going through podcast episodes, interviews, books, talks from 246 practitioners across 15 skill areas.  \n  \nHere are the some of my top mental models/frameworks:  \n1. Annie Duke's \"wanna bet?\" test. Before any big decision, put an actual probability on your confidence. It's uncomfortable but it catches the \"I'm sure this will work\" moments before they cost real money.  \n  \n2. Hormozi's Value Equation. When you're losing deals, it's almost never \"better messaging.\" It's the denominator (time delay and effort/sacrifice). I wasted months on copy when the real problem was onboarding friction.  \n  \n3. Sean Ellis test. If less than 40% of users would be \"very disappointed\" without your product, stop scaling. Fix the product first.  \n  \n4. Chris Voss's two-word test. \"You're right\" means they're done with you. \"That's right\" means breakthrough. Two words apart, completely opposite outcomes on sales calls. This one is annoyingly accurate.  \n  \n5. Jeb Blount on prospecting. The outreach you do today pays off in 90 days, not tomorrow. Most founders quit before the lag catches up.  \n  \n6. Geoff Smart on hiring. Can the candidate get their last boss on the phone right now? That one question tells you more than a full interview.  \n  \n7. Uri Levine. 30 days into a new hire, would you rehire them? If you paused before answering, fire immediately.  \n  \n8. Marty Cagan. Most product teams are just feature factories. Real product teams solve problems they can measure.  \n  \n9. Barbara Minto's pyramid principle. Lead with the answer. Context second. I catch myself burying the point in every deck and email. Still working on this one.  \n  \n10. Cal Newport. Every context switch costs 23 minutes of recovery. Schedule deep work blocks or they don't happen.  \n  \nThe thing that bugs me: if you ask ChatGPT about any of these, it knows who Annie Duke is. It'll explain the concept. But it won't actually apply the \"wanna bet?\" test to your specific decision unless you load the framework in yourself. The gap between knowing about a framework and being able to use it in \"just in time\" moment is the biggest gap.   \n  \nWhich of these do you actually use day-to-day? Not ones you've heard of. Ones you actually apply.",

    "selftext": "I run a SaaS company as my main thing, but I've always wanted to build something on the side that was simpler... and fully automate-able by AI.  \n  \nA few months ago I was planning a trip to Japan and hit the same wall everyone hits: the research phase is brutal. You're piecing together blog posts, Reddit threads, Google Maps saves, trying to build a coherent day-by-day plan. I spent more hours planning than I'd spend on some of the actual days.  \n  \nSo I built Tabiji, an AI that generates full travel itineraries. Not the generic \"visit the Eiffel Tower\" stuff. Real recommendations, walkable routes, the kind of places you'd find if you spent 20 hours on Reddit travel subs.  \n  \nWhat surprised me?  \n  \n**1. People don't pay for AI. They pay for curation.**  \n  \nEveryone has access to ChatGPT. The itineraries it spits out are... fine. Generic. The thing people actually pay for is someone filtering the noise. My edge isn't the AI itself, it's that I obsessively curate what makes it into the output. If I wouldn't recommend it to a friend, it gets cut.  \n  \n**2. The first sale came way faster than I expected.**  \n  \nI launched on a Saturday, shared it in a couple places, and had a paid order by the following week. No ads, no influencer deals. Just a product that solved a real problem I personally had. There's something about scratching your own itch. You already know exactly what \"good\" looks like.  \n  \n**3. Fulfillment is the actual business.**  \n  \nBuilding the product was the fun part. But the thing that makes people come back and tell their friends? The delivery experience. Every custom itinerary gets a branded page, a personalized email, real attention to detail. That's not AI, that's just giving a shit.  \n  \n**4. Static sites + Stripe + AI = absurdly low overhead.**  \n  \nMy costs are basically AI API calls and a domain. No servers to maintain, no team to manage. Revenue is modest but the margins are wild. This wouldn't have been possible even two years ago.  \n  \n**Where I'm at now:**  \n  \n\\~50 paid orders fulfilled, growing through SEO and word of mouth. No paid acquisition. I'm not trying to turn this into a venture-backed thing. I like that it's small, profitable, and something I personally use.  \n  \n**The meta-lesson:**  \n  \nThe best side project isn't the cleverest idea. It's the one where you're the customer. I built Tabiji because **I** needed it. Turns out a lot of other people did too.  \n  \nHappy to answer questions about the build, pricing strategy, or how I think about AI products vs. AI features.",

The shoots were high quality and looked their best light. The only problem is that they barely got any likes. At this point I hadn\u2019t realise I\u2019d flopped. I invested in Instagram ads and expensive creators. Then the website opened and I only received 5 sales. Within the streetwear market basically all the sales are in the first 24 hours to a week, therefore I knew I had flopped.\n\nThe main fix may be consistent social media posts on TikTok and Instagram. Once I get consistent engagement, then I could build up the release again. The problem is this is far too time consuming, especially since my A levels are coming up. The only problem is practically all my money I had made from the two years of running the business is tied up in the joggers, meaning I would have nothing for the summer. \n\nI have thought about various methods that are high engagement, organic and low costs. But have come to realise this may be too good to be true. I thought about posters on corner shop doors, this would only cost a few pounds per week but wonder who would actually look at them. I could also do sticker campaigns which show the joggers and a QR code but wonder if people would trust that. After my exams I have 2 weeks where I could do a popup store, this could be my chance to sell them out, although that\u2019s risky as it leaves it very late and it could mean I loose even more of my money.\n\nLastly the joggers have a high unit cost so any sort of price promotion is out of the question. \n\nAny help or advice would be greatly appreciated.

I had one client paying $4k monthly, but taking 38 per cent of our time. Constant scope creep, unrealistic expectations, and midnight messages. When I fired them, my team's output on remaining clients improved dramatically. One of those clients referred two new clients who paid more than the fired one.\n\nThe second breakthrough was niching down. We were doing everything for everyone. Social, email, ads, content, SEO. When I picked one service for one industry, our close rate went from 18 per cent to 38 per cent. Prospects saw us as specialists, not generalists.\n\nProductizing our service changed everything. Instead of custom quotes, we created 4 fixed-priced packages. This eliminated negotiation, attracted better clients, and made delivery predictable. Clients self-selected into the package that fit their needs.\n\nLead generation was too long under founder-led leadership. I was doing all the outreach myself, which meant the pipeline dried up when I got busy with delivery. Hiring a part-time appointment setter at $3k monthly freed 18 hours weekly and generated more consistent meetings.\n\nThe referral system took intentional effort. I started asking happy clients directly: \"Is there anyone else you know dealing with the same challenge you were?\" About 33 per cent gave at least one name. Referral leads close at 53 per cent versus 28 per cent for cold outreach.\n\nPricing increases happened 3 times in the past year. Each time, I was nervous about losing clients. Each time, retention was fine and new clients came in at higher rates. We were underpriced for the value delivered.\n\nThe team structure evolved. Started with just me, then contractors, then 3 full-time employees. The key hire was an operations person who handles client communication and project management. This let me focus on sales and strategy.\n\nCase studies became the best sales tool. Instead of talking about what we could do, I showed what we did. Three detailed case studies with specific numbers generated more trust than any sales pitch.\n\nThe monthly retainer model provides predictability but requires constant value delivery. We send weekly reports showing exactly what we did and what results we achieved. Clients who see the value stay. Clients who don't see it should probably not be clients.\n\nCurrent MRR is $86k from 13 clients. The average client value is $7k per month. Churn is under 5 per cent monthly because we're selective about who we take on.\n\nThe biggest lesson: agency growth isn't about getting more clients. It's about getting the right clients and delivering exceptional results for them. Everything else follows from that",

    "selftext": "Hello, folks.\n\nFrustrated recent grad here. Couldn't land an entry level job due to lack of real world experience and projects. So I've decided to try my hand at running a small business. Either it works, at which point I will double down on it, or if it does not, at least I will have some experience behind my belt. \"Shoot for the moon, if you miss, you'll land among the stars\" type of situation.\n\nThe business is a simple one, it has been done, it works. A bundled web and internet services for a niche. Niche being the tradespeople since they are abundant in my area, and many of them lack websites, CRM, etc. And the service is very blanket-type where many industries from within the trades world could use such services. I should not be short for potential customers with this approach.\n\nI have read from several sources the advice that you should not lower your prices. That you should instead negotiate to add/remove features, this advice makes sense to me.\n\nHowever, I also recognise that pitching my services to an old dog who has been in business for decades is a fool's errand, particularly when I am just starting out.\n\nSo here is the idea that I'd like to bounce off of you:\n\nMy business' pricing structure is that of a typical SaaS model:\n\n* Set-up fee (non-refundable) \n* Recurring monthly fee\n* Pay as you go / Cancel any time\n* 3 tier offer\n\nWhat if I place something like this before the user scrolls to the priced tiers:\n\n*\"We recognise that starting out is a difficult time for anyone entering the trades world as a solo-trader. If you are just starting out or your business is &lt;1 year old, we will forgo the set-up fee and slash the recurring fee by 50% for your first year\".*\n\nMy thinking here:\n\n1. Old dogs who have been in the business for years are not going to care for whatever CRM solution I will offer. After all, their business has functioned just fine\n2. (Most) Old dogs probably don't even care to have a website. They get their jobs through referrals because they have been around and people just know them\n\nWhat I am betting on here are young people who are just entering the trades. Particularly gen-z, and maybe some younger millennials.\n\n1. Gen-z will not like it if they always have to answer a phone. I believe gen-z would rather a more techy approach, like a CRM.\n2. Gen-z would need a professional, modern, SEO-friendly, optimized website to be discoverable.\n\nYes, for the first year I will be giving away my services for pennies on a dollar - but doesn't every agency/SaaS/freelancer does that to begin with? \n\n\n\nWhat do you think? Good, bad idea?\n\n\n\nSome other things to consider:\n\n1. Since the full price offer is pay as you go/cancel any time - would it be wise to lock someone into a 1-year contract if they avail of this offer? \n2. I will definitely be forgoing the set-up fee, to lower barrier of entry - but is 50% off of recurring payments too steep? Should I maybe instead do a payment plan where it starts as 50% and gradually increases over the year to pay back the difference?\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nSome thoughts as I have sat here and re-read this 3 times...\n\nI am not convinced locking someone into a contract is a smart move here. A young tradesperson might have doubts about his career choice. One slow month and they could bail. Leaving me with unpaid/low-paid labor for the website and CRM build out. Maybe the following is a smarter approach:\n\n* No set-up fee\n* Slashing 50% off of recurring payments\n* No contract\n\nBUT! they must pay for 6 months up front. 6 month seems like a healthy amount of time to commit to something, to see if it really works, let website and CRM do its thing. And this will cover my cost too.\n\nThoughts?\n\nI will need to make effort that that I have a personal Ycode template, a snapshot of HighLevel build out (which I am currently working on), and on-boarding ready to go. Need to keep labor effort at near zero...\n\n  \n\\---\n\n  \nSome context if that helps you to give me an advice:\n\n* Graphic Design bachelor. UI/UX diploma. PCC marketing certificate.\n* I've freelanced before and have been in managerial positions twice in my life. So \"running\" things is not new to me.\n* Websites will not be vibe-coded. I will be creating them in Ycode, a great visual builder focused on speed, CMS, and integrations.\n* For CRM it's HighLevel. For edge-cases it's N8N.\n* Features I will offer are things that work and sell well, they provide real value - like missed call text-back, automated lead capture, confirmations, follow-ups, reminders, appointment management, and so on.\n* I've got a 40-50h a week retail job. I don't need to borrow money for anything, I can fund this myself - but I am very eager and driven to make this work.\n\n\n\nThank you for your contribution.",

The opportunity wasn't in building \"TikTok analytics.\" It was in building TikTok analytics for creators and finding a certain pain point for individual creators, not brands or agencies. Same market, narrower niche with promising demand. Some people building \"for everyone.\" A lot of the promising demand comes from building for someone specific. Distribution is still hard, growth is still slow, but opportunity exists if you stop trying to be everything to everyone. What \"dead\" market did you find life in by going narrow?",

    "selftext": "My last post blew up more and i did not expect that and i had people question my methodology and how accurate numbers are. So i thought i might as well share i come across winning digital products. \n\nHowever for some context, numbers that show up on any spytool will never be to the core but will give you an edge on whether or not something is working. \n\nHere's the actual process I use. Facebook Ads Library first. Go to meta ads library and search terms like \"ebook,\" \"template,\" \"digital guide,\" \"notion,\" \"printable.\" Filter to active ads.\n\nThe thing you're looking for is ads that have been running for weeks or months. Nobody keeps spending money on ads that don't convert. If something's been running since January it's working. Screenshot everything the hook, the visual, how they describe the problem, what they promise. That's not inspiration, that's validated market data handed to you for free.\n\nI then would head over to Etsy and search \"digital downloads\" or get more specific with your niche. Sort by bestseller or look for listings with thousands of reviews. You're not looking at one product, you're looking at patterns what problems keep coming up, what formats sell, what price points people accept without friction.\n\nA listing with 4,000 sales isn't luck. That's a real problem with real demand and a proven format people are comfortable buying.\n\nI would use Shophunter which is a spy tool to see if a brand is scaling, downscaling, or stuck at the same numbers. Now again the spytool is not accurate and it is only a use of measure to give me confidence to say this brand has a winning digital product. Relying on the spytools metrics would never be enough for me to study a brand. \n\nTikTok for real-time demand signals. Search your niche plus words like \"printable\" or \"digital product\" or \"template.\" Look for videos with high views and then read the comments. When you see comments like \"where can I get this\" or \"do you sell this anywhere\" that's people telling you directly what they want to buy.\n\nComments are more valuable than view counts here. Views mean the content is interesting. Comments asking where to buy mean there's actual purchase intent.\n\nReddit for the problem side. This is the one people skip but it's genuinely useful. Search your niche plus \"problem\" or \"struggling with\" or \"frustrated by.\" You're not looking for product ideas here, you're looking for how people describe their pain in their own words.\n\nThat language ends up in your title, your sales page, your DMs. When your product description uses the exact words someone used to describe their problem it feels like you read their mind.\n\nWhat to do with all of it, after a few hours across these four places you'll start seeing the same problems come up repeatedly. Same pain points, similar product formats, consistent price ranges. That overlap is where you build.\n\nYou're not guessing anymore at that point. You're building a version of something the market already told you it wants, with your own angle on it. The whole research process takes like 3-4 hours if you actually sit down and do it. Most people skip it and spend 3 months building something nobody asked for.\n\nDo the research first. Saves a lot of pain later.",

Its actually the first time I have ever written down my thoughts and what I'm going through. So bear with me lol it's gonna be long, so sorry in advance. I just need to get this all out because right now my head is in scrambles and I genuinely don't know what to do anymore.\n\nI'm 27, turning 28, living in Canada. Been trying to build businesses since I was about 22. I was the first person in my whole friend group to go the whole entrepreneur thing, and honestly, I think I motivated most of them to level up too. One of my boys landed his first six figure job partly because of the mindset shift we all went through together. But here I am, the guy who started it all, and I still haven't crossed six figures in a year.\n\nI have also learned a lot about myself through these years, and I think I learn slower than most people. I've watched guys I literally know start ecom while I was doing it go from nothing to 20k days in like a year plus, while I'm still trying to figure out how to be consistent at 10k months. But I also feel like when I finally learn something, I really master it. Just takes me longer to get there.\n\nAnyway, let me walk you through everything chronologically because its been a ride.\n\nSo back in 2020 when COVID hit, Canada gave us CERB which was 2k a month. I was a university student and that money was honestly life changing for me. Not because of the amount but because of how it made me feel. I've always been a huge car guy and the year before I had this Acura TL manual six speed that I loved. When CERB started coming in I told my boys if I save for a few months and yall lend me some cash I can get my dream car. At the time that was a BMW 335i manual convertible going for like 10 to 12k.\n\nMy closest friend lent me 4k, another boy lent me 2k, and I got the car like a month later. And man. That car changed my life and I mean that in a dramatic way. Driving through downtown Toronto at night with the top down, Drake playing lol, my girl at the time in the passenger seat, people on the street saying nice car. I can't even describe that feeling. I was driving my dream car, not working, still getting money deposited. It was the first time I'd ever been to a nice \"expensive\" restaurant and just felt like I was living.\n\nThen CERB stopped around August and reality hit. Couldn't afford anything. Went back to school but ended up dropping out, got a job. Life felt genuinely depressing because that feeling was just gone and it felt so far away from ever coming back.\n\nSo I sold the BMW. Paid my boys back. Had about 3k left. And I said fuck it let me try to build something.\n\nFirst thing I tried was dropshipping around 2021. Gimmicky products, tried a clothing brand, tried selling shisha hookahs. Nothing worked. I did manage to hit 1k in a day for like 3 days at one point but nothing was profitable or consistent. I've gone back to ecom multiple times over the years because it checks all my boxes. 1. You don't need to show your face. 2. You can scale to the moon. 3. You can do it from anywhere in the world. But its only ever lost me money. I think I'm finally accepting ecom just isn't it for me.\n\nThen around 2023 I got into cleaning. Saw it blowing up on Twitter and jumped in. First time I actually made real money. Hit my first 5k month profit and I was mindblown. But the industry became a race to the bottom SO fast. A 300 dollar cleaning dropped to like 180 to 200 within months. My profit per job went from 100 bucks to basically nothing.\n\nThrough cleaning, I met a guy doing Airbnb property management and he told me to get into it. Thats what I've been doing since 2024 and its made me the most money out of anything. Crossed my first 10k and 15k month profit. I was probably one of the first people running Facebook ads for this in Toronto which gave me a real edge early on.\n\nBut now I'm stuck and heres why.\n\nThe numbers just don't work the way I thought they would. When I got into this I assumed most properties would do like 10k a month and I'd be making 1000+ per property at my 15% cut. Reality is most properties average like 3 to 4k a month and its super seasonal. Peak months a property might hit 10k but in November or February that same property drops to 3k. 15% of 3k is 450 bucks. Thats nothing.\n\nI have about 15 properties right now. In the peak season, the properties generate around 100k a month in revenue, 15% is roughly 15k but I also have overhead so it ends up around 10k to 12k profit. In the low season I'm at like 4k. And thats before software and overhead costs. My best client has a 9 cabin resort that did 47k in one month last summer and I made about 3k off it. Thats my BEST client. If 3k a month is the ceiling per client the math just doesn't add up unless I somehow get to 200+ properties which creates a whole other set of problems like needing full time staff and dealing with way more overhead.\n\nOn top of that Toronto has been cracking down hard on Airbnb. They blame us for the housing crisis even though STR properties are less than 1% of housing stock in the city. So we are the low hanging fruit. Regulations in the city say you can only Airbnb the unit you actually live in (primary residence), you're also limited to 180 days a year of renting it out on Airbnb then you gotta switch to 6 month rentals, most cities around Toronto now need permits, and basically one client equals one property. For my clients, most of them aren't gonna go through the hassle of changing their driver's license address for verification and getting new permits every time they want to add a new property. They just don't care enough to do all that.\n\nLead gen wise, I can get leads cheap. About 3 bucks each, 60 to 70 leads a week on about 500 in ad spend. But the conversion is brutal. Out of 100 leads, 15 to 20 have a property that's not garbage, 5 of those actually want to start within a few months, and maybe 1 or 2 are ready to go within a couple weeks. So my close rate is like 1 to 2% (garbage). And I don't even break even on a client until about 3 months in. I just don't see how to scale this.\n\nSo here's what I've been thinking about. I know I'm a good marketer. Generating cheap leads is something I can do consistently, and I've learned how to apply marketing tactics across different industries. So I'm looking at starting a marketing agency. Two directions I'm considering.\n\nFirst one is marketing for SaaS companies. Charge a big upfront fee like 10 to 12k plus a 4 to 6k monthly retainer. Help them move from low ticket subscription models to higher ticket sales. I've seen this model being done before and know someone who ran this exact model and collected 170k cash in like 60 days. 10 clients at 10k is 100k in cash collected in a month. The math is beautiful on paper.\n\nSecond one is marketing for mortgage brokers which is closer to what I already know since I'm in real estate. Tiered pricing. 3k a month with 500 going to ad spend so 2500 profit, or 4k a month, or 6k a month with more ad spend. 4 to 5 clients at the base tier gets me to 10k profit. I already tested out an offer and started running ads for this and got about 10 leads in the first few days, which is promising.\n\nI also know I need to start creating content and putting my face out there which I've been avoiding. But I think its necessary at this point if I want to build a real lead magnet (plus I just need to do something different).\n\nNow here's the personal side of things and why this is urgent.\n\nMy parents are in their 70s going into their 80s. They're not working anymore. Their expenses are becoming my expenses. Not by choice but because thats just the reality of the situation. I'm back against the wall financially. What I'm making now isn't keeping up with how fast things are adding up.\n\nI've sacrificed a lot for this. Stopped hanging out with friends as much. Put basically everything into trying to make this work. I've probably generated close to 2 million in gross revenue over the last 3 years across all my businesses but that hasn't translated into the financial position I thought I'd be in. When I was 22, I thought by 27 I'd be living on my own, downtown with a BMW M2 lol but instead I'm at home grinding trying to figure out my next move.\n\nI'm not trying to be dramatic, and I know I've grown. But I also don't want to keep doing the same thing and expecting different results.\n\nSo I guess my questions are.\n\nShould I keep pushing the STR business? It's made me the most money, but the ceiling is low, scaling is brutal, and Toronto regs are working against me. It also requires me to be in person and local, which goes against what I originally wanted.\n\nShould I go all in on the marketing agency? It checks more boxes and the margins are way better. But I don't want to fall into shiny object syndrome. If I can't hit 10k a month within 6 months I'd consider it pointless.\n\nAm I just wasting my time overall? Because honestly, I could probably get a job paying 5 to 6k a month and end up in the same spot financially without all this stress. That thought keeps me up at night.\n\nFor anyone who's been through something similar or scaled past where I am. What am I not seeing? What would you do?\n\nAppreciate anyone who actually read all this. My head's been a mess and I just need some real talk from people who get it.",

Instead of focusing on selling Smartphones, i will center the buiseness on high demand accessories like cover, charges, cables, screen guard and camera lens etc products. People frequently need but usually buy from unorganized, inconsistent shops. Customers will be able to either walk into store or order through through a app for same day delivery within defined area . In addition, small but time sensitive services such as screen guard replacement, camera lens replacement, minor repairs, and pick up and drop repairs can be booked as home service, making the buiseness convenience first rather than local dependent. To focus on retention a structured a structured a loyalty system will encourage repeat behaviour. Shifting retention from discounts to relationship and trust. In a normal shop customer doesn't get any trust or loose connection with customer when they leave the shop and no guarantee they will come again or but from other shops.\n\nI'm still young entrepreneur Please share if you have any advice to improve.",

We can have it to see you availability and put down appointment or meetings for you. The AI sends you a notification email, text, or even call you.\n\n4. We can have it to help customers placing orders and get it printed out or paid via a payment link.\n\n5. If you give the AI some ideal customer profile, it can go on the internet and find people that might be interested into your product and service. Then the AI will send them a quick qualification question and let you know when it find a good lead.\n\n6. If you provide the AI with dormant customer info, it can reach out to them based on the info you have about them.\n\nI am thinking about building a package product for these but I am not sure which industry I should target to.

So i am in 10th class juggling my education with all this stuff while excelling in my studies (like coming 2-3th position with 3 hours of sleep after working all night type of things) as it was one of my only edge that let me do this IT stuff after school while not failing classes.\n\nso for the next two years i will be doing alot of studying and preparing for a competitive exam inorder to get into a good college (IIT's) in order to persue my education in computer science\n\ni cant fumble as the next 5-8 years of my life will decide the entire trajectory of my life and i can't get my self to think of myself doing a corporate job after all this effort that i have spent on learning countless skills early on in life. i cant fail after arguing hearing all these taunts from people warning me about getting a job and being safe and shit\n\n  \nso the reason i told you all of this backstory is that i wanted to share the current state i am in and that is why i need some guidance to how i can like prepare myself or learn specific skills so that i can handle a IT startup in parallel while persuing studies with the help of my father.  \nsince my father already has the networking stuff done due to him being in the manufacturing industry, i wont have to bother with all this inital momentum of a startup and knowing how to run one starting on. he already has planned to get a GSTIN registered for me when i turn 18 (GSTIN is just something assigned to business for tax related stuff)",

They are by small delays in the deadlines, while the income statement still seems healthy.\n\nThe most relevant idea I've seen is to consider cash flow delays as a problem of integrity. It is necessary to compare what should happen according to the terms of the contract with what is actually happening, then observe the evolution of liquidity over a 13-week horizon with a cautious approach, and not be content with a simple estimate.\n\nIf you have already experienced a cash flow crisis, what are the indicators you follow every week to really trigger a quick action? Is a 13-week horizon enough to make important decisions such as freezing hiring or reducing costs? And what is the element that teams never update, the one that diverts cash flow forecasts over time? Why it works: it's written like a real operator who thinks out loud, it requires concrete practices rather than opinions, and it invites people to share what doesn't work in real life, which naturally brings out points for improvement.",

    "selftext": "I\u2019m 16, from argentina. The economy down here is pretty tough, and I've watched my dad work insanely hard his whole life just to provide for us. A while back, he sat me down and honestly told me it was time I learned the value of a dollar and started making my own money. I'm really lucky that my parents work hard to send me to a good school. Since I was a kid I've always loved math, but more recently that obsession shifted to backend programming, data infrastructure, and understanding how businesses operate.\n\nI started grinding on that and managed to land 4 or 5 projects (paid) for companies, mostly just keeping my head down and fixing technical bottlenecks for them.\n\nLast year, i bought an ecommerce course from a huge ecom influencer. He's actually one of the good guys, not a scammer. I ended up pivoting away from ecom entirely, but I stayed in his paid community chat because I had already paid for access.\n\nA couple of days ago, he posted an announcement. His own community operations had a massive bottleneck and he desperately needed a custom tool built to automate it.\n\nI DM him. I just mapped out exactly how i would structure the data and build the backend to solve his exact problem, like i did for th other companies. He loved it. Told me I stood out from all the other devs who replied. We just closed the deal for $2,400. It\u2019s going to be a tough build, but I\u2019m hungry for the work. It proved to me that you have to be noisy, show up, and that business owners really don't care how old you are if you can actually fix their headaches.\n\nFor the business owners and operators here,since I\u2019m still young and want to scale this B2B backend work, what advice would you give me?",

    "selftext": "Enterprise AI adoption discussions usually blame the workforce: \"people don\u2019t know how to use it,\" \"teams won\u2019t collaborate,\" \"data is messy,\" \"IT is slow.\"\n\nIn practice, the decisive variable is often leadership. Not whether the CEO *says* they care about AI, but whether they enable the conditions that make AI work.\n\nHere are 6 failure modes I keep seeing. Many orgs hit multiple at once.\n\n# Failure mode #1: Trend-chasing (\"use the newest\") replaces bottleneck removal \n\nWhen novelty becomes the goal, everything turns into a treadmill:\n\n* Tool release cadence &gt; business iteration cadence\n* Demos look magical, but die on permissions, data access, and edge cases\n* Evaluation becomes \"does it look like AI\" instead of \"what constraint did it remove\"\n\n**Fix:** Start from a specific bottleneck. Then choose the minimum toolchain that patches that constraint. AI is not \"buy new.\" AI is \"patch the constraint.\"\n\n# Failure mode #2: Metric theater (measurable is mistaken for correct) \n\nI\u2019ve seen teams measure \"percent of code written by AI\" as a north-star KPI. That incentivizes output volume, not delivery quality. AI\u2019s real impact is usually uneven:\n\n* Faster exploration and low-risk edits\n* Not necessarily faster in complex systems, long debug chains, or aligning on ambiguous requirements **Fix:** Measure business outcomes: cycle time, defect rate, incident frequency, support load, onboarding time, review throughput.\n\n# Failure mode #3: Penny-wise AI (forcing free tiers and weak models) \n\nCommon pattern:\n\n* Employees are pushed onto free plans\n* They spend time hunting for free alternatives\n* Leadership concludes \"AI isn\u2019t that good\"\n\nThat\u2019s not validation. That\u2019s self-sabotage. \n\n**Fix:** Fund production-grade capability and governance (model quality, shared context/KB, permissions, audit logs, budget). Reliability requires infrastructure, not vibes.\n\n# Failure mode #4: Zero tolerance for friction (treating the learning curve as failure) \n\nAdoption has real integration cost:\n\n* People learn task decomposition, constraints, acceptance criteria\n* Processes need review, rollback, and testing gates\n* Outputs must conform to architecture and conventions\n\nIf leadership's response is:\n\n* No visible improvement in 2 weeks -&gt; kill it\n* One incident -&gt; ban it\n* No low-risk pilots -&gt; \"only perfect deployments\" Then the org learns: \"touch AI, take blame.\" \n\n\n\n**Fix:** Scoped pilots, explicit tolerance for calibration, and safe surfaces for experimentation.\n\n# Failure mode #5: No target (\"AI transformation\" with no workflow objective) \n\nSlogans like \"embrace AI,\" \"use AI to improve efficiency,\" and \"everyone must learn AI\" collapse when you ask the only question that matters: *Which workflow segment is being optimized, and what cost/error class is being reduced?* \n\n**Fix:** Treat it like an engineering project: clear inputs/outputs, acceptance criteria, ownership boundaries, ROI hypothesis.\n\n# Failure mode #6: Buying seats and calling it done \n\nThe real drag in enterprises isn\u2019t writing. It\u2019s coordination cost:\n\n* Ambiguous requirements -&gt; rework\n* Opaque information -&gt; constant re-alignment\n* Docs/code drift\n* Permissions/handoffs break\n\nAI lands when it\u2019s embedded into workflow nodes, e.g.:\n\n* **Intake:** auto-assemble context, generate acceptance checklists\n* **Dev:** draft tests, run static checks, produce migration notes\n* **Release:** regression summaries, risk flags\n* **Ops/Content:** bulk generation + low-cost QC + selection\n\nThis rarely happens bottom-up. It requires cross-team rules, permissions, and process changes. That\u2019s leadership territory.",

Each one was impressive on its own. Put together, it was kind of a disaster. Things \u201cworked\u201d, but no one really knew why. Tiny changes caused random regressions, PRs passed tests but broke behavior, and we spent a lot of time re-prompting just to get back to yesterday\u2019s state.\n\nAt some point it became obvious the issue wasn\u2019t the models. It was that we were asking AI to *decide* what to build and *build it* at the same time. That\u2019s where everything kept drifting.\n\nWhat helped was splitting those two phases apart. Before letting any agent touch code, we started writing down intent in plain language. Nothing fancy. Just what the feature should do, what it absolutely should not do, a few edge cases, and what \u201cdone\u201d actually means. Once that existed, the AI\u2019s role changed. It stopped guessing and just executed.\n\nWe tried a few variations of this. Sometimes it was just markdown in the repo. Sometimes Notion plus manual checks. Sometimes GitHub issues with stricter templates. We also experimented with tools like Traycer that formalize specs and check changes against them, and even some lightweight internal checklists. Different setups, same outcome.\n\nThe consistent pattern was that once intent was frozen, the AI stopped freelancing.\n\nAfter that, Cursor and Claude actually felt reliable again. Reviews sped up. Fewer rewrites. Less back-and-forth arguing with outputs. We didn\u2019t switch models or chase the next release. We just added structure.\n\nThere probably isn\u2019t a single \u201cright\u201d tool here. Some teams will be fine with docs and discipline, others will want something more structured. But if AI feels powerful yet unpredictable in your workflow, the problem might not be the model. It might just be that the contract isn\u2019t clear enough.\n\nGenuinely curious how others are dealing with this, especially on bigger repos or with multiple agents running at once.",

    "selftext": "Hey r/startups,\n\n\n\nI launched something in January called Memefluence and I\u2019d genuinely love some honest feedback.\n\n\n\nQuick background on me. I\u2019ve been running meme pages since 2011. Started on Twitter, built some of the bigger accounts back then, and ended up helping brands grow when they saw the engagement we were getting. Over time I noticed a pattern. A lot of startups were spending serious money on growth tools and platforms, sometimes hundreds of thousands, and the engagement just didn\u2019t justify the spend. CPMs were high and the content didn\u2019t feel native.\n\n\n\nSo I built something around the network I already had.\n\n\n\nMemefluence is basically a vetted network of meme pages that post native content for brands. No bots, no fake engagement, no automation tricks. Just creators who already live on explore pages and understand internet culture.\n\n\n\nSince January we\u2019ve done:\n\n\n\n32.2 million views\n\n2 million likes\n\n4,300 posts\n\n8 clients\n\n6.36 percent engagement rate\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve had multiple clients double or triple their budgets after seeing the results.\n\n\n\nThe model is simple. Brands get native distribution inside the algorithm instead of just running paid ads. Pages get paid to create and post content that fits their audience. We focus heavily on US based reach and keeping CPM efficient.\n\n\n\nWould love for you guys to roast it. Does the positioning make sense? Does it feel legit? Is it clear what we actually do? What would you change if this were your company?\n\n\n\nBe brutal. I\u2019d rather hear it from Reddit than from a potential client.\n\n\n\nAppreciate any feedback.\n\n\n\nI\u2019d love for you guys to roast the website and the positioning. Does it make sense?

I do not know where to start.\n\nI know what everyones thinking. If its so profitable why are you selling it of just trading it yourself and getting rich?\n\nThe honest answer is capital. A good edge does not mean returns. If I have $5000 and my model returns 10 percent a month that's $500.\n\nIt's a percentage but its a terrible dollar amount.\n\nTo actually make life-changing money from it I would need capital behind it which I do not have right now.\n\nSo making it accessible to traders while I build is just the logical move.\n\nI started to code the website. This is the home page I could probably think of. I am also not sure what to add on the right section.\n\n* Any suggestions?\n* Anyone who has built something, like this before\n* What does a site actually need to convert someone whos never heard of you?\n* I would appreciate any feedback.",

    "selftext": "Been studying ad patterns lately. Not in a guru \"I found the secret\" way, just genuinely trying to understand what real people spend real money on.\n\nThis one's worth breaking down.\n\nStore called Elvasma. $214K monthly. Main product is a 66-page Bible study guide one page per book of the Bible. Simple premise. The kind of thing you could probably explain to someone in 10 seconds.\n\nAnd they're not alone. I found at least 6 stores running nearly identical models right now, all apparently doing real volume.\n\nThey're not targeting \"Christians\" broadly. They're targeting a very specific version of guilt the busy mom who genuinely wants to grow spiritually but keeps falling off because real Bible study feels like homework. She's not looking to be convinced she has a problem. She already knows. She's looking for something that makes the solution feel actually doable.\n\nA 66-page guide that breaks down all 66 books hits that perfectly. It's not asking her to become a theologian. It's giving her permission to start small.\n\nThe offer is Buy 2 Get 1 Free at $69.98, plus a free Bible app, mystery gift, and 365-day study plan thrown in. Lots of perceived value stacked on a product that probably costs a few dollars to print and ship. That math works really well when your buyer is already emotionally sold before they hit the page.\n\nWhat I found interesting about the ads. They're finding Christian creators on TikTok people who already make faith content, prayer videos, that kind of thing and building ads that flow like a natural continuation of that content. Tonally it feels like advice, not an ad.\n\nWorth noting though there are reports of some stores in this space using AI voice cloning to make it sound like real creators are endorsing the product when they're not. That's a line I'd be careful about. Aside from the obvious ethical problems, the FTC has been paying more attention to synthetic endorsements lately and it's the kind of thing that can end a store fast. Mentioning it because I've seen it in the wild, not because it's worth copying.\n\nWhat makes this model work isn't the Bible niche specifically. It's the combination of an emotionally loaded problem that already has an audience, a product that feels like a realistic fix rather than an overwhelming commitment, and a price point with room to bundle.\n\nThe 6 competitors running the same model is actually the interesting part. Usually when you see that many people copying something it means the unit economics are real, not just one lucky store.\n\nAnyway. Thought it was worth laying out.\n\n  \nEdit: Subreddit doesn't allow screenshots, however i got the data metrics from shophunter and no it does not mean that these numbers are true to the core but it aims for an accurate level. Also this is not a self promotion, i just found this while studying on other digital products and thought this was crazy. ",

    "selftext": "So I have taken advantage of recent AI developments to make over $30,000/month per model, and I run 11 models.\n\nTo put it roughly, I create promotional content to drive traffic into my models page, I use reels for Instagram and pictures for Reddit. As I gain new fans to the page, my chatters chat with them, turn them on, and eventually sell locked ppv videos for the fan to unlock/buy. What I look for and the type of people that make me money ins this space, we call them whales, these guys will spend $1000's of dollars on videos, or just tipping you for chatting to you because it makes them feel good, 3 whales which pay $1000 a week, is $12k a month, and this is so reasonable to do.\n\nI personally feel I have hit a soft cap regarding earnings, simply because of the size of the platform I use to monetise my model's userbase, aswell as the trust people have with AI content. BUT, I really believe that as time goes on, people will become desensitised to AI adult content, same way everyone was saying, AI will steal all our jobs 2 years ago, now people want AI to work for them, same way a year ago people wouldn't give a second look at an AI model, but now we are in the transition process of desensitisation. So this soft cap will slowly go away and my earnings will grow far above than what they are at now.\n\nSo like I said I have 11 AI models, and with this I built a big team of chatters, VA's and an AI guy I have personally trained to help me make content for my models. In turn I have found a lot more free time in my day, and I am naturally a working man, I always need to be doing something, so I did decide to teach aswell, 1-1 mentorships and video lessons, good bit of extra income and very rewarding when students get wins\n\nI've also been looking at creating my own credit based website, where users can generate high quality AI content or purchase content directly, as looking at these websites there quality is terrible and I know I can do better, but it's alot of work haha\n\nI do get a lot of questions, why did I start this? with my 11 models, I have built a big team of chatters/ VA's and an AI guy I have personally trained to help make content for my 11 models, I found a lot of free time in my hands, because my \"ceo'ing\" of this business only consisted of calls with chatting managers and on a Sunday I batch create the promotional to promote and sfw to sell.\n\nBut yea I don't want to make this too long, I know this is a polarising topic so please keep the comments only for questions, but I can happily give advice for those who are starting or for those who are looking to start.",

    "selftext": "For twelve months, I worked on my first product almost every day.\n\nIt was a tool meant to help people move more during desk work. I believed in it because I needed it myself. I refined the flows, improved the reminders, redesigned parts of the interface more times than I want to admit, and kept adding features that I thought would make it more complete.\n\nI worked on it early in the morning before my job and late at night after my family went to bed. From the outside, it probably looked like discipline. I was consistent. I was shipping. I was improving things constantly.\n\nBut the truth is that I was building in silence.\n\nPeople signed up. Some told me it was a good idea. A few tried it briefly. But nobody was asking for specific improvements. Nobody was pushing me for features. Nobody was waiting for updates.\n\nAnd nobody paid.\n\nAfter twelve months, the revenue was \u20ac0.\n\nWhat hurt was not just the number. It was the realization that I had spent an entire year building based on my own assumptions. Every feature felt logical to me. I had reasons for all of it. The problem was that those reasons lived only in my head.\n\nI had a roadmap for that product, but it was my roadmap. It was basically a structured list of guesses.\n\nAt some point, I had to admit that I did not have a feedback problem. I had a visibility problem. I had no real way of seeing what people actually cared about before I built it.\n\nThat frustration led me to build something else.\n\nNot another feature for the first product, but a tool I personally needed: a way to make a roadmap public, to let users submit ideas, to let them upvote what mattered to them, and to create real signal before writing code.\n\nI built that after the twelve months of silence.\n\nIronically, the second product took a fraction of the time. And it generated revenue.\n\nNot because I suddenly became better at marketing or more disciplined. I was already disciplined. The difference was that I stopped deciding alone.\n\nWhat surprised me most was how wrong I had been about priorities. Features I thought were essential barely received attention. Ideas I would have postponed quickly rose to the top when users could vote.\n\nThat shift changed how I think about building.\n\nThe first product failed financially, but it exposed the flaw in how I was making decisions. The second product exists because the first one forced me to confront that I was guessing in isolation.\n\nI am still trying to figure out how to consistently build with real pull instead of self-generated momentum.\n\nCurious how others realize they are building in silence before a year goes by.",
